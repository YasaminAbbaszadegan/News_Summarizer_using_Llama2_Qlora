### handler.py

- A handler in Hugging Face helps manage API endpoints.
- It acts like a middleman between incoming requests and the model.
- When someone sends a request to the API, the handler processes it.
- It sends the data to the model for prediction.
- Then, it formats the model's response before sending it back.
So, handlers are crucial for making sure the API works smoothly and interacts correctly with the deployed model.
