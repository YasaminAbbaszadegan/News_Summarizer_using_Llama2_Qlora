And Kim Kardashian is so passionate about make-up that she and her sisters have just launched their own beauty range. Despite all this, her boyfriend Kanye West is actually a fan of the low maintenance look and prefers Kim - who has famously revealed the work that goes into her beauty routine - without a scrap of make-up. Revelation: Kim Kardashian has revealed in an interview that rapper beau Kanye West actually prefers her more natural look . The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star revealed 36-year-old Kanye's preference for her bare-faced look in an interview with Feelunique.com. She said: 'He loves the dress up aspect, but he also likes me without make-up on.' And it seems that Kim is taking a more relaxed approach to her beauty regime because of this. A source told Us Weekly that she hasn't worn any make-up since the arrival of her daughter four weeks ago. 'She has always had a schedule with every hour of the day taken,' 'Now, she hasn’t had her hair or make-up done since she had the baby,' said the insider. How he likes her: Whilst Kim said that Kanye likes it when she dresses up (R) he loves her without make-up (L) and a source has revealed that she hasn't even worn any make-up since the birth of her daughter a month ago . But the oh-so-polished Kim, 32, revealed that, like every other woman, she has suffered many make-up and fashion disasters in her time. She cites matching eye shadow to her hair accessories and clothes as the worst of her make-up faux pas. But thanks to years of practice it seems that Kim knows what she's doing. A number of the beauty products from her new line sold out within a matter of hours on beauty e-tailer Feelunique when they went on sale on Monday, with some fans being put on a waiting list for some sold-out products.

3,97,"Dallas (CNN) -- Five decades after it served as the backdrop for a nation's grief and disbelief, Dallas' Dealey Plaza took center stage once again Friday as Americans commemorated the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. ""A new era dawned and another waned a half century ago when hope and hatred collided right here in Dallas,"" Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said in his remarks commemorating Kennedy's death. Rawlings then read the final words of the speech Kennedy was to deliver that day. That was followed by a moment of silence at 12:30 p.m., the time Kennedy was shot a few feet from where Rawlings spoke. Bells tolled, and after a brief pause, cadets from the Naval Academy sang ""America the Beautiful."" Historian David McCullough read excerpts from famous Kennedy speeches. Some 5,000 invited guests were expected to attend the commemorative events, which was bookended by bagpipers -- a JFK favorite -- playing under a spitting gray sky. The tightly choreographed and secured event was the culmination of a series of commemorations Friday, including wreath-laying events in Kennedy's home town of Boston and at his Arlington National Cemetery gravesite. In Washington, where flags flew at half-staff over the Capitol and White House, Kennedy's last living sibling, Jean Kennedy Smith, participated in the Arlington wreath-laying. Earlier, Attorney General Eric Holder visited the gravesite. And in the House of Representatives, where Kennedy served from 1947 to 1953, the Rev. John Robert Skeldon of Fort Worth, Texas, reminded lawmakers in his opening prayers that ""in commemorating such a one whose life and presidency were cut short, we do so not to sow in tears, as the psalmist says, but rather to reap with shouts of joy."" ""Help us, Lord God, to make the late President's inaugural vision our own so that together as fellow Americans we may 'ask not what our country can do for us, but rather what we can do for our country,'"" Skeldon prayed, invoking Kennedy's famous words. The Dallas event was designed to be a delicate balancing act of honoring Kennedy's memory without sensationalizing his murder, and to help the city throw off its reputation as ""the city that killed Kennedy."" It opened with a video from an organizer speaking of that goal, and continued in Rawlings remarks, which keyed off Kennedy's call for the United States to embrace and conquer a ""New Frontier"" of challenges . The mayor spoke of a Dallas that took up the mantle of Kennedy's challenge of American betterment and transformed itself with a ""sense of industry born of tragedy"" into a city that he hopes would make the president proud. ""He and our city will forever be linked, in tragedy, yes,"" Rawlings said. ""But out of that tragedy, an opportunity was granted to us: the chance to learn how to face the future when it's the darkest and most uncertain, how to hold high the torch even when the flame flickers and threatens to go out."" Boy who witnessed JFK assassination recalls the day . JFK assassination a collective memory for American children . A new JFK monument also was unveiled, in the infamous section of land known as the ""grassy knoll."" The inscription on the monument is the final paragraph of the speech JFK intended to deliver at the Dallas Trade Mart on November 22, 1963: . ""We in this country, in this generation, are --- by destiny rather than choice --- the watchmen on the walls of world freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be worthy of our power and responsibility, that we may exercise our strength with wisdom and restraint, and that we may achieve in our time and for all time the ancient vision of ""peace on earth, good will toward men."" That must always be our goal, and the righteousness of our cause must always underlie our strength. For as was written long ago, ""except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain."" Is there more to the JFK assassination? Other Dallas events . Conspiracy theorists, who have typically gathered on the plaza on each anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, were barred from the plaza. Instead, The Dallas Morning News reported, the group planned to hold an event at the nearby JFK memorial, and then move to Dealey Plaza after the main event was over. Demonstrators gathered at Dealey Plaza on Thursday, and many chanted: ""No more lies. No more lies."" The remarkable Sixth Floor Museum, which chronicles the Kennedy assassination, was set to open from 3 to 8 p.m. CT. Parkland Hospital, where Kennedy died, planned a brief morning ceremony, where the flag will be lowered to half-staff. Also in Dallas on Friday, a candlelight vigil for J.D. Tippit was set for 6 p.m. at the site where the 39-year-old Dallas police officer was shot. ""I think the remembrance of him calls attention to all of the officers killed in the line of duty. We should remember those who have given their lives for our city,"" Marie Tippit, who had been married to the officer for 17 years, told the Los Angeles Times this week. She told the paper she will also attend the ceremony at Dealey Plaza. 5 things you might not know about JFK's assassination .

Commemorations elsewhere . 50 years later, Jackie Kennedy's pink suit locked away from view . The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston asked visitors to gather to watch a video musical tribute to the President that includes James Taylor. A moment of silence was held at 2 p.m. ET, the time when a doctor approximated Kennedy died. Moments of silence were also planned at various other locations around the nation. And online, a handful of Twitter accounts focused on recreating Kennedy's movements that fateful day, culminating in breaking accounts of the aftermath of the shooting.

The parents of a two-year-old boy who was living with his grandparents, have been arrested in Malaysia after allegedly kidnapping him and fleeing the country last weekend. The South Australian couple, aged 26 and 23, were arrested by Malaysian authorities on Thursday and have been charged with aggravated unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction. In accordance with South Australian law, the offence could see them sentenced to a prison term of up to 19 years. Arrangements for the toddler's safe return to Australia are currently being made. Scroll down for video . A South Australian couple have been arrested in Malaysia after kidnapping their two-year-old son and fleeing the country last weekend, Chief Superintendent John Venditto revealed . Australian police have also charged the child's 64-year-old grandfather and 52-year-old grandmother' with aiding and abetting in the unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction', according to a police statement. The grandparents failed to notify authorities, for more than 24 hours, that the two-year-old had left their care. It has also been alleged that they 'handed the boy over to his parents on Saturday August 2'. Police refused to reveal why the parents had lost custody of their child or if they had a criminal record, however they did reveal that 'the child was under an assessment and investigation order that was issued by the courts' at the time he was taken. Police refused to reveal why the parents had lost custody of their child or if they had a criminal record at a press conference on Friday, however they did reveal that 'the child was under an assessment and investigation order that was issued by the courts' Chief Superintendent John Venditto said at a press conference that the entire operation took only six days from the moment police were informed that the child was missing until the arrest of his parents. 'It is an extraordinarily quick and rapid response to something that would generally take a lot longer,' he said. Chief Inspector Tony Crameri, the officer in charge of the investigation, said the child's well-being was the priority throughout the operation. 'This was an incredibly delicate investigation and we were mindful that the parents could flee at any moment with the boy to an unknown location,' he said. The parents could face up to 19 years in jail according to South Australian law, while the grandparents, who  have also been charged, are expected to appear at the Holden Hill Magistrates court (pictured) in October . 'Such a quick and positive outcome could not have been achieved without the cooperation of a number national and international agencies, including Interpol, the Royal Malaysian Police, Malaysian Government, Commonwealth Attorney Generals Department, Department of Foreign Affairs, South Australia DPP and the Australian Federal Police,' he said. The parents have so far appeared at a Malaysian court and will now be remanded for the customary 60 days until the case will resume. Australian authorities are awaiting for decisions surrounding their extradition and any further charges to be decided by Malaysian authorities. Meanwhile, the toddler's grandparents have been granted bail and are set to appear in the Holden Hill Magistrates Court on 14 October. Their charges could also lead to a lengthy jail sentence, according to police.","The couple, from South Australia, have been charged with aggravated unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction .

A 21-year-old Michigan man flagged down to help a woman who . had just given birth on the side of the road is being credited for saving her baby's life after successfully performing CPR on the . child. Ryan Cornelissen, 21, says he was driving to the bank in Macomb Township on March 16th  when he discovered the baby's frantic father on the side of the road, signaling him to stop. Pulling his car to the side, the troubled man, who appeared to speak only a little English, immediately handed him a phone already connected to 911. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Unexpected: Ryan Cornelissen, 21, says it was the child's father standing on the side of the road waving for help that led him to find the woman who had just given birth on the side of the road . Saved: The college student did exactly as police dispatch told him to do, gently tilting the baby's head back and performing CPR, which got this little girl breathing . Looking inside the car, Mr Cornelissen discovered the man's wife and his newborn daughter who didn't appear to be breathing. 'Something’s wrong with his wife, he doesn’t speak very good English. He stopped me on the side of the road,' Mr Cornelissen is heard saying in the 911 call obtained by WDIV. Looking inside the car he says he saw the woman seated in the front seat with a blanket. Also with her, the head of a newborn baby girl. 'She just had a baby,' Mr Cornelissen calmly tells police as a woman's cries are heard behind him. 'She just had a baby?' dispatch asks. 'Yeah,' he answers. What happened next, however, took a lot more from him than just pulling over and talking to 911. Realizing the baby wasn't breathing, dispatch informed him that he'd have to perform CPR. Help: It was on the road that Mr Cornelissen discovered the father and his wife needing help for their baby who wasn't breathing . Relief: The baby is pictured shortly after with her mother in the hospital, a stay that will last several weeks as she improves . Mr Cornelissen, a man who weighs 290lbs and played football in high school, was told to take the baby’s tiny head in his hands - a child weighing a mere 3lbs, 8oz - and do exactly as they instructed. 'Tilt its head back just a little, but not too much, OK? ... You're going to cover the baby's nose and mouth with your mouth,' a dispatcher instructs him. 'I did the second breath and I stepped back and he goes, ""is the baby breathing?"" I said no. And then all of a sudden the baby made a crying face.' 'Yes!' Mr Cornelissen is heard exclaiming in the phone call. 'I remember the face to a T,' he later said before making a scrunched up wailing face and then smiling. 'That was the face. I swear to God. That was the face. It was awesome.' The baby is said to be doing fine but will have to stay in the hospital for several weeks. In the meantime the baby's parents have already welcomed Mr Cornelissen into their home and say they hope he'll stay in their little girl's life. Meeting: Mr Cornelissen meets the baby's father for the first time, in an emotional reunion the father says he hopes won't be the first . Premature: The little girl was born premature, weighing just 3lb, 8oz but is said to be doing well . No big deal: Mr Cornelissen, a local college student hoping to one day become a police officer himself, says that he doesn't think what he did was a big deal . Seen greeting the new dad outside his home, the father embraced him with a big hug telling him, 'I'm very happy to see you again.' He then whipped out his digital camera and showed Mr Cornelissen a number of pictures since taken of his little girl. In one photo, taken next to her mother, the baby’s seen wearing a bright pink bow in her black hair. 'I didn't think it was that big of a deal but apparently everyone else does,' Mr Cornelissen laughed.

6,127,"By . Sarah Griffiths . At first glance this map might look like a Catherine Wheel spitting out colourful sparks, but this stunning image in fact shows the routes of millions of commuters who journey into London every day. The map was created by an academic who used data collected by 50 million Oyster card journeys to investigate how people arrive at their workplace in capital. The result is fresh look at the busiest stations used by commuters and while there are some notoriously hectic spots like Bank listed, there are also some surprising omissions, including King’s Cross station. Dr Manley's map shows the connections formed between all London stations and their most popular destinations.  A link has been drawn between the two places, and the link and points coloured according to the destination. Each destination is given a different colour . Dr Ed Manley, a research associate at University College London's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (Casa) created the map based on data collected at the busiest times on weekday mornings – between 7am and 10am. ‘Looking at morning peak, as we have done here, we can start to understand a little more about the relationship between where people live and where they work,’ he told the Standard. His map suggests that City workers are most likely to live in east London or Essex, while people living south of the Thames tend to use Waterloo, London Bridge or Victoria to get to get to work. The trends indicated by the map (pictured) hint at the interdependencies that underlie the relationships between places in London.  It is clear, for example, that much of travel from south London is focussed on just three end points ¿ Waterloo, Victoria, and London Bridge. He told MailOnline: 'I think the map shows some well understood and some not-so-obvious trends. The fact that travel from south London is attracted to only three main stations - Victoria, Waterloo and London Bridge - is maybe predictable, but the map reflects well the dependency that south London holds on these few stations. 'Likewise, the strong connections between the City and east London may be well known, but the map shows how widely this influence spreads.' The data represents 48.9 million journeys documented over 49 days in the summer of 2012 - which average out at one million morning peak trips per day and night. Strikingly, King’s Cross station is missing from the map. Dr Manley explained in a blog post that despite popular perceptions, the station is not a popular end-point for commuters as there are currently not many offices nearby, but it remains one of London’s busiest stations. Dr Ed Manley, a research associate at University College London's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (Casa) created the map as a different way to understand London's travel network. here, the iconic London Underground map is pictured . The data represents 48.9million journeys documented over 49 days in the summer of 2012 - which average out at one million morning peak trips per day and - strikingly King's Cross station (pictured) is missing from the map. Dr Manley explained in a blog post that despite popular perceptions, the station is not a popular end-point for commuters . ‘This may not be where people end their trips. They [commuters] may well pass through King’s Cross St Pancras – indeed, a failure at King’s Cross could be catastrophic for many travellers – but it is not where the leave the system,’ he wrote. ‘In this sense, King’s Cross is an important point on the network but not a place that many people actually get off.’ 'The same might be said for places like Baker Street and Green Park - important points on the network, but not the final destination for many,' he told MailOnline. Some of London’s tourist hotspots and business hubs have unpredictable travel patterns as they attract people who live all over London and its sprawling suburbs. Locations such as Oxford Circus and Canary Wharf attract travellers from all over the city, Dr Manley explained. Dr Manley said: 'I think the map shows some well understood and some not-so-obvious trends. The fact that travel from south London is attracted to only three main stations - Victoria, Waterloo and London Bridge - is maybe predictable, but the map reflects well the dependency that south London holds on these few stations . He said that the popular shopping destination’s star-like distribution of links indicates that it is attractive to commuters from all over the capital. ‘Canary Wharf, too, shows a spread of origin points to the east, the north-west along the Jubilee line and to the south-east,’ he wrote. Dr Murray believes the trends might show the accessibility of these stations across multiple routes and their accessibility from all over the London. 'The general assumption too is that most travel revolves around central London, but the map reflects a different story in the outer suburbs. 'As we move away from central London, the influence of places like Hammersmith, Uxbridge, Stratford, Croydon and Barking increases and there are clearly some very important local patterns in these areas.' His work is part of ongoing research into how Oyster Card data can describe travel behaviour in London. 'The aim is that the lessons we learn here can be used to inform how we improve and extend the transport network in London,' he added.","An academic at University College London investigated how people get to work around the capital and found some surprising omissions, including King’s Cross station, which is not an end destination for many commuters .

7,90,"(CNN)A tense encounter on the road. Gunshots cutting across a neighborhood cul-de-sac in Las Vegas. That's what ended the life of Tammy Meyers -- the latest face of road rage in America. But there are still a lot of unanswered questions in the case. Here's a look at some of them: . Authorities have identified the alleged gunman as Erich Milton Nowsch Jr., who was arrested after a tense standoff Thursday. He will face murder and two other felony charges, according to court documents. The other two counts are attempted murder and discharge of a firearm from a vehicle. She's a 44-year-old mother of four and grandmother of one, described by her husband as ""a beautiful woman"" who loved him, ""her kids and ... a lot of other people."" ""She never did anything bad to anybody,"" her husband Robert Meyers said. Nor did she put up with nonsense, he added, explaining that ""if she was in the Marines, she would have been a master sergeant."" And, Robert Meyers added, ""She hated bullies."" Giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson. The two went to the parking lot of a nearby school, where the teen got behind the wheel. Then they switched places, with Tammy Meyers driving back home. Yes. And Lt. Ray Steiber, a Las Vegas homicide detective who is heading the investigation into Meyers' death, suggested this isn't unusual. He notes that Nevada requires first-time drivers ""to log nighttime driver hours"" to get their license. ""When I taught my children how to drive, there were certain aspects of driving that they needed to learn,"" Steiber said. ""And one of them was driving at night."" Nothing much out of the ordinary at the actual lesson. It's what happened afterward that's key. As the mother drove her daughter home, she was still giving her daughter a lesson on how to merge lanes and turn properly on a public roadway, when she spotted a ""vehicle speeding up rapidly behind her,"" Steiber said. That vehicle, a sedan, pulled up behind her and then to the side of her. It was then that Meyers' 15-year-old daughter ""reached over while her mom was driving and honked the horn,"" the detective said. ""She was getting a driving lesson, so she figured that this person was speeding and ... needed to be corrected,"" said Steiber. ""Right or wrong, she beeped the horn."" That got the other driver's attention: He pulled in front of the Meyers' car, stopped, then walked back toward the mother and daughter. He said something to them -- exactly what hasn't been stated publicly -- but Meyers and her daughter aren't believed to have responded, according to the detective. Tammy Meyers' husband told HLN's Nancy Grace that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter. She went back home, and told her teenage daughter to go into the house, wake up her brother Brandon and ask him to get into the car. Brandon Meyers, 22, brought a registered gun with him. Tammy Meyers was scared and upset, Steiber said of the woman's feelings at the time. She then drove back out of her neighborhood to the scene of the confrontation to see if she could find the man she'd clashed with, the detective said. Robert Myers said his son and wife were trying to move the car. They didn't want the car to be recognized in front of their home. But the other car, described as a gray or silver sedan, saw them, he said. Robert Meyers texted: ""My wife and son drove away from home, bad guys following. She lost them and upon coming home turned on street, bad guys are right in front. ""After that, bad guys open fire different location. My wife got home, told her son to take cover and after he saw his mom shot he opened fire three times maybe four."" That's a judgment call and may depend, in part, on what transpired earlier. ""Yes, maybe in a make-up world she should have stayed home. Please remember statement from this animal, 'I'm going to kill you and your daughter,' "" said Robert Myers. Steiber said only that police don't think Tammy Meyers did anything wrong criminally. Her husband, who was out of state at the time, has said, ""My wife paid the ultimate price for it because of the mistakes she made."" Las Vegas detectives have given a slightly different version of events than Meyers' husband, saying the mother drove home to pick up her armed son and went back out to look for the suspect and his car. According to Steiber, ""at one point Mrs. Meyers was following what we consider a suspect vehicle. And then, at another point, they broke apart and Mrs. Meyers went home."" The detective said that the second encounter happened at least 5 minutes after Meyers went home the first time and everything unfolded ""within a couple blocks"" of each other. She and her son got out of her car. Then, a sedan pulled into her cul-de-sac from which someone started firing. Meyers' son, Brandon, shot back, Steiber said. The car with the shooter then backed out and drove away. It was then that Brandon Meyers discovered ""his mother, who was standing off to the side and behind him, had been struck by gunfire,"" Steiber said. It's right after that, at 11:22 p.m., that relatives and neighbors first alerted police. No one is denying that Brandon Meyers used his gun. Still, Steiber said that police believe a bullet from the sedan driver's gun -- not that of her son -- killed Tammy Meyers. As the standoff unfolded Thursday, the victim's husband approached reporters. ""Are you all happy? You made my wife look like an animal ... and my son. There's the animal, a block away. Are you happy?"" Robert Meyers said, obviously agitated. Speaking at a vigil Tuesday, he said ""There were mistakes. ... But this particular mistake was made to keep a bigger mistake from happening."" ""My son is not an animal,"" Robert Meyers said. ""My son is a hero in my book."" The 22-year-old says he was just trying to protect his family. ""Everyone can think what they have to think,"" Brandon Meyers said. ""I did it for a reason, and I'd do it for anyone I loved."" Road rage: Cameras and guns only add to the problem . They're hurting. A week after the shooting, Tammy Meyers still hadn't been buried. But loved ones did hold the candlelight vigil, one that Robert Meyers said was meant ""to show my respects to my wife and to let her kids get some of this grief off (their chests) and heal."" ""It's going to take a lot more than this to do it,"" he added. Yes. Robert Meyers alluded to such criticism -- specifically related to the difference between the family's initial accounts and the timeline later related by police -- in a Facebook post. ""I was told one version of what happened to my wife ... and I never said anything different than (what I was) told,"" he wrote late Wednesday night. ""If all of you people ... think I was a fraud and lied about facts, I'm truly sorry."" In the same Facebook post, Meyers said all money raised for the family via GoFundMe -- an account that Meyers said a friend started -- will be returned. The related GoFundMe page has been shut down. But Robert Meyers told reporters that his family knew the accused gunman. ""We know this boy. He knew where I lived,"" he said. Calling it an ""open and ongoing investigation,"" Steiber said authorities are still piecing together exactly what happened and who is responsible. Police are using video and other evidence to try and get ""an accurate timeline and an accurate depiction of what occurred,"" Steiber said. ""That takes time."" The detective did say that authorities don't have any reason to believe that this incident is tied to anything else. Police believe it was ""an isolated incident involving road rage that ended in a tragic murder,"" he said.

8,259,"The brothers accused of strangling Autumn Pasquale may have been implicated after they exchanged a chilling message on Facebook hours after she was murdered. Justin, 15, and Dante Robinson, 17, are accused of killing the New Jersey 12-year-old for her BMX . bike parts. Their mother turned them in after she allegedly saw a message Justin wrote to his older brother simply saying 'Autumn'. The boys have been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit . murder, disposing of a body, tampering with evidence and theft. Justin . was also charged with luring. Justin also wrote on his Facebook wall 'Might be moving', followed by a sad face and 'liked' the page set up to find her, despite allegedly knowing she was already dead. Scroll down for videos . Brothers: Dante, 17, left, and Justin, 15, right, are accused of luring Autumn Pasquale to their home with the promise of bike parts and murdering her . Clues: Justin Robinson wrote on his Facebook wall 'Might be moving', followed by a sad face and 'liked' the page set up to find her, despite allegedly knowing she was already dead . Evidence: An investigator loads into a police van a BMX bicycle in Clayton, New Jersey, removed yesterday from the house where the body of Autumn Pasquale was found . The same? Authorities did not confirm the bike was the one belonging to Autumn, but it matched the description of the white BMX she was seen riding Saturday afternoon before she disappeared . Police believe the teens lured 12-year-old 'tomboy' Autumn Pasquale to their home on Saturday night under the pretense of trading bike parts and killed her. An autopsy performed yesterday . concluded she had died from 'blunt force trauma, consistent with . strangulation'. She was also beaten. There was no evidence of sexual . assault. Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean . Dalton said the boys may have wanted parts from Autumn’s bike. They . turned themselves in on Tuesday. Justin is a student at Clayton High . School, while Dante is a student at Bankbridge Regional School in . Gloucester County, a school for students with behavioral and . developmental disabilities. Tragic end: Autumn Pasquale's body was recovered late Monday night from a recycling bin . On Sunday night, while people from all . over the area were searching for Autumn, Justin joined the 17,000 . people on Facebook who liked the FIND AUTUMN PASQUALE page, according to Philly.com. A break in the case came when the . teens' mother alerted investigators to a Facebook post on one of her . son's accounts, though it is not clear which son and what the post . actually said. After obtaining a warrant to search the teens' home, authorities found . some of Autumn’s belongings including the white BMX bike she was last . seen riding when she left her West High Street home Saturday afternoon . around 12:30pm. The house was a place where teens . frequently hung out and had parties, some neighbors said, and one of the . brothers often bought and sold BMX bicycle parts. According to Philly.com, family and . friends were already leaving messages on Justin Robinson's wall saying . they loved him and asking him to pray for forgiveness. The teen's eldest brother Michael wrote: 'I love you so much little brother.' Some messages however, were not so . supportive. Autumn's older brother A.J wrote: 'I know u won't see this . but I'm just letting u know that I am coming for [you] next time I see . ur face or ur brother donte [sic] I'm kicking ur asses.' It is unclear whether Dante had a Facebook or not. Yesterday, an investigator wheeled a . white, BMX-style bicycle from the Robinson house. Autumn's uncle James . Spadafora is said to have recognized it immediately and holding his . mouth said: 'Oh, my God, no. Oh, my God, that's it.' Investigators also took bicycle rims from the house. Dalton said his office was 'strongly considering' waiving both teens to adult court. Mourning: Sisters Alexis and Bethany Davis, left, cry at a shrine for Autumn Pasquale yesterday not far from where her body was found . Authorities found . some of Autumn’s belongings in the teens' house including the white BMX bike she was last . seen riding when she left her West High Street home Saturday afternoon . around 12:30pm .

Family ties: Paul Spadafora, left, and Mary Pasquale, right, the uncle and grandmother of Autumn Pasquale, sit together at a gathering outside town hall yesterday . Grief: People weep at the gathering outside town hall earlier yesterday as authorities revealed they believed they had found Autumn's body . The boys themselves were in plain . sight at points in the intense search for Autumn. Several people in town . said they saw them both at the vigil held on Monday night in hopes that . she would be found while allegedly knowing exactly where she was. Joyce Fisher, who lives across the street from the boys, said: 'We all thought that he was some creep luring children.' Philip Wames, another neighbor, said he was conflicted. 'It's almost like a relief that it's not some creepo,' he said. Announcement: Prosecutor Sean Dalton addresses a gathering outside town hall yesterday . The boys are expected in court for a detention hearings Friday. Autumn's body was discovered on Monday night in a blue recycling bin. Tuesday was trash collection day, . and many residents had dragged their trash cans and recycling bins to . the curb the night before. The covered recycling bins are collected by . an automated truck that picks them up and dumps the contents into the . back. Police barricaded the block, and . friends and neighbors came by to see. Some mothers said they were . keeping their kids out of school for the day. Even before the body was . found, students reported that Spirit Week had been canceled because of . the sorrow. One young man rode a bike up, sat on a porch of a home and cried, then biked away. Clayton Mayor Thomas Bianco walked to . the scene, cried, hugged a police officer and gave a brief statement to . the gathered reporters. 'You hear about it in other places but never think it would happen in our little town,' he said. Howard Kowgill, 60, who lives in town . and, like many, knows members of Autumn's family, said the discovery of . the body changes the nature of the town. Dalton said: 'This is a very sad . day for the Pasquale family. Our hearts go out to the family and to all . the residents of Clayton who stood together in support of this young . girl.' About 200 law enforcement officials and hundreds more volunteers searched for Autumn after she was reported missing.

Clayton home where she lives with her father, her two siblings, her . father's girlfriend and the girlfriend's children. A . friend, DeAnna Edwards-McMillen, 11, said Autumn was at her . house on Friday night and they exchanged text messages on Saturday. She . said she received the last one at 1.22pm and didn't believe it was . intended for her. She said it read, 'don't be like that'. DeAnna . said her friend was nice and easy to be around: 'She didn't hate . people and . people didn't hate her.' DeAnna's mother, Debi McMillen, said that Autumn was often at their house and that she always went home before her 8pm curfew. The . last known communication was in a text message she sent at around 2.30pm. Mr Dalton would not say who received . the message or what it contained, but he added that there was nothing . alarming or unusual about it. It . wasn't until about 9.30pm that she was reported missing - 90 minutes . past her 8pm curfew, said Paul Spadofora, a family spokesman, the uncle . of Autumn's father and the girl's godfather.

The three-time world heavyweight champion was diagnosed with the disease in 1984 but his condition has gradually deteriorated and he is now mostly housebound. He was too ill to attend a premiere of a film about his life last week and his condition meant he could not take part in the production of the movie either. Scroll down for video . Muhammad Ali is said to be so ill from Parkinson's that he can barely talk, according to his brother Rahman Ali . His brother Rahman, 71, attended the screening of I Am Ali in Hollywood, and told The Sunday People: ‘I have not been able to talk to my brother about this because he is sick. ‘He doesn’t speak too well. But he is proud that we are here for him. He has given this film his blessing.’ While his daughter Maryum, 46, who was also at the premiere, said her father would love the film and it will make him laugh and cry.

Nicknamed the Louisville Lip for his infamous wit, Ali remained active for several years after his diagnosis and made a moving appearance at the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games where he lit the flame. However, the sporting icon, who retired from boxing after suffering several strokes, was seen looking particularly thin and frail at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony where he was helped across the stage by wife Lonnie.

Ali pictured at the Sports For Peace Fundraising Ball in London in 2012 (left) and in his heyday in 1974 (right) In February 2013 his brother Rahman said Ali was so crippled by the degenerative brain condition that has afflicted many ex-boxers, he might not survive until the summer. He also made claims that the family had been barred from seeing Ali, who is estimated to be worth more than £50million, and could only speak to him on the phone. Rahman said his brother was ‘a prisoner in his own home’ and he is being gravely mistreated by his wife because ‘she is more interested in Ali's money than his well-being’.

A 99-year-old great-grandmother has been forced to crawl up two flights of stairs to her flat for two weeks because the lift is broken. Mary Goble, who is disabled after contracting shingles, says she has been left a prisoner in her own home as she waits for the repair work at the nine-storey building in Birmingham, West Midlands. The great-grandmother-of-eight attempted to leave the house to buy groceries, but after realising she would have to go up the stairs on her hands and knees, she has vowed not to go out again. She said: 'I went to go and get some food in but when I got back realised I would have to crawl upstairs on my hands and knees. 'I had to pull myself up knee by knee, it's outrageous - these stairs are very steep. 'I was in pain and when I got to the top I was exhausted. It nearly knocked me out.' The partially-sighted widow, who lives alone, was left with limited mobility in her hands and arms after she developed shingles. She believes the lifts at Beech Hill House in Bartley Green, Birmingham, are more than six decades old. She added: 'This lift should've been dealt with a long time ago. They should've realised that, with a lift that's 60-years-old. It is dangerous. 'I normally wake up in the morning and think ""I must do something and get out, buy some flowers or go to the shop"". 'But if you go out you've got to crawl back up the stairs again. 'The only way people can get in and out is up and down the stairs. Other people have complained to the housing department about this. 'I feel for the others living here. Most of them are aged 45 or over and some are disabled.' Residents were told in a letter  from the Bartley Green housing team that the lift was broken.

11,330,"When it comes to regrets, the fox in the box has a few – possibly starting with the label given to him by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Injuries, expectations, attitude. Three words to sum up why a career that promised so much for Francis Jeffers ultimately disappointed. These days Jeffers’s main claim to fame is to be compared to Wayne Rooney and cited as an example of how two teenage prodigies from the same neck of the woods could take such diverging paths. VIDEO Scroll down for Wayne Rooney makes England senior debut with Francis Jeffers . Francis Jeffers and Wayne Rooney made their England debuts in the same game, against Australia in 2003 . Rooney (left) is now preparing for his 100th cap while Jeffers was most recently playing for Accrington Stanley . The 'fox in the box' scored in the game against Australia at Upton Park, his only goal in his only appearance . England captain Rooney, 28, celebrates his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday while Jeffers, 33, is back on Mersyeside learning how to be a coach. They both made their Everton debuts at 16 although Rooney was 38 days younger. They made their England debuts in the same match, a 3-1 defeat by Australia in 2003. Jeffers never played for the seniors again. Yet for a while it looked as if Jeffers was destined to be as big a star as Rooney eventually became. When Wenger paid £8million for him in 2001, he was supposed to be the English bees knees, the final piece of the Arsenal jigsaw. Three years later he was on his way to Charlton for £2.4million. Two FA Cup medals were in the trophy cabinet although injury meant that Jeffers was not part of the final match-day squad on either occasion. Jeffers built up his reputation as a youngster at Everton and signed for Arsenal for £8million . Jeffers praises Arsene Wenger for being honest with him and admits he looks back on his career with regrets . Jeffers scored four goals in 22 Premier League appearances for the Gunners and was sold soon after . During his time at Arsenal, Jeffers was linked to many clubs with wages a stumbling block. These words from David Gold, then co-owner of Birmingham, could almost have been prophetic. He said: ‘If he wants to sit at Arsenal on his big contract and play golf every day, rather than get on with his career, then he can continue with that. ‘Jeffers has got at most 10 years left - and losing something like 150 grand a year is not something I would see as a good career move to be honest. ‘But if the alternative is sitting on your backside doing nothing, where is the motivation in that?’ Good question and one that Jeffers answers honestly. ‘I was out, partying, living life – tossing it off in training because I always thought I wouldn’t play Saturday anyway. Now I look back with a lot of regrets,’ he admitted to the Independent. ‘That is where I should have been putting it in more. Arsène Wenger gave me a fair crack of the whip. I haven’t got a bad word to say about him. He tells you how it is, one of the only managers I played for who did. Jeffers and Rooney make up the Everton bench after the former returned to Merseyside . Rooney, unlike Jeffers, didn't score in the game against Australia but has been a revelation ever since . ‘He said there were things going on in my head that shouldn’t have been and that it was an important time in my career. I am not saying I threw it all away because I had a decent career. I fulfilled a lot of ambition but I always say it, I know how much ability I had. I’m not soft. I know how good a player I was. One England cap wasn’t enough.’ In Jeffers’s defence, his body let him down too. Ankle and shoulder injuries struck on what became a long and winding road from Charlton, to Blackburn, to Sheffield Wednesday, to Newcastle United Jets in Australia, to Motherwell, to Floriana (Malta) and to Acrrington Stanley. There was a loan move to Rangers in there, too, but what should have been a six-month stint was cut short. ‘For some reason, even towards the end when my career was fizzling out, the press have always taken a big interest in me and what I did,’ Jeffers added. ‘I don’t know whether people think the same as I think which is: I should have been better.’ Injuries halted Jeffers' career, who had limited success with Charlton among with many other English sides .","Francis Jeffers and Wayne Rooney played for England vs Australia in 2003 .

12,52,"(CNN) -- Authorities searched Tuesday for a man they say sexually assaulted and stabbed a lone hiker at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. The National Park Service released a sketch and offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator in Friday afternoon's assault on Gatlinburg Trail near the city of the same name. The 44-year-old victim, who officials said did not know her attacker, managed to make her way afterward to Gatlinburg Bypass, where she flagged down a motorist, officials said. Rangers and National Park Service special agents were working more than 50 leads received on a tip line, said Molly Schroer, spokeswoman for the park, the most visited in the nation. What's in a trail hiker's backpack? The suspect was described as a white male in his 40s, of thin build, about 5 feet 9 inches tall, with a dirty blond crew cut and a thin mustache. He was wearing glasses, black dress pants and a gray T-shirt. Multiple tattoos include an unknown word across his abdomen. The hiker suffered multiple stab wounds on her neck, shoulder and hand. She was airlifted to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, where she was released Sunday.

He sits out the international following his red card against Azerbaijan in October. VIDEO Scroll down for Manchester United's Jonny Evans on his favourite books . Squad: Michael O'Neill named a 26-man squad for Northern Ireland's game against Hungary next month . Evans gifted the League One Dons their opening goal of the cup game and the two men who combined to punish the mistake - Ben Reeves and Will Grigg - are both in O'Neill's squad. A handful of senior players who missed the summer tour of South America, including Chris Brunt, Gareth McAuley, Kyle Lafferty and Jamie Ward, all make their comebacks for the Sunday, September 7 match in Budapest. With Evans absent and O'Neill expected to stick with his preferred 3-5-2 formation, the group is packed with defensive options - including seven players capable of operating at centre-half.

15,397,"A Beaver Scout group has been hit by allegations of an affair between its married leader and one of the women who volunteers there after her partner made claims on the group's webpage. Software developer Billy Fagan, 36, posted a message on the website of Stonywood Scouts, in Aberdeen, yesterday, accusing partner Catherine Mcneice, 35, of being unfaithful. In the message, which he described as 'whisky-infused', he claimed Miss McNiece, who he has at least one child with, had been sleeping with scout leader Gareme Lornie, 48. Billy Fagan, 36 (left), used the website of the Stonywood Scouts, based near Aberdeen, to post a  message claiming partner Catherine Mcneice, 35 (right), was having an affair with leader Gareme Lornie, 48 . In the message Mr Fagan claims Miss Mcneice had been exchanging flirtatious texts with married Mr Lornie (pictured) since last summer . The letter was entitled 'Leaders in Love' and had a sub heading, which read 'two of our leaders scouting each other out (wink, wink).' He wrote: 'Yes, our Beavers leader Catherine and our Scout leader Graeme have recently found a liking for each other’s attentions. And who can blame them! 'Following their regular nights together at scouts and all their camping adventures they've decided to take their love into the digital age with a series of texts showing their involvement. 'Over the past eight months  they've shared numerous flirtatious texts.' Mr Fagan went on to claim that the text messages began last summer, adding that Mr Lornie's wife had also been unaware they were writing to one another. He then offered to make the conversations available 'upon request', before adding: 'Billy, Catherine's partner and writer of this whisky-infused post, wishes them all the best for a long and happy life together. In the message, entitled 'Leaders in Love' with the second headling 'Two of our leaders scouting each other out (wink wink), Mr Fagan describes himself as 'whisky-infused' Mr Fagan was unavailable to comment on the message, but has since posted on Facebook telling his friends: 'All is fine here thanks guys. My good pal Glen (Livet) is sorting the day out fabulously' 'Obviously this affair should not be allowed to affect the running of the Stoneywood Scouts and indeed, it's being kept well under wraps.' In the final part of the message he wrote that Scouts had been given a 'seedy' reputation in the press recently, likely referring to recent allegations of sexual abuse within the movement. But, he wrote, the alleged affair should not be treated 'as a reflection of scouting as a whole'. He stated: 'I have never known anyone involved in scouts, as a scout themselves or as a leader, who has not gotten a whole lot of value out of being part of the movement. 'Everyone speaks highly of the organisation, the commitment of the volunteers and the integrity of the leaders to ensure it's a safe and appropriate part of your children's upbringings.' When contacted about the claims yesterday, Miss Mcneice and Mr Lornie both refused to comment. Mr Lornie (left) has been married to wife Kay for 27 years, who said the message 'did not come as a surprise'. Miss Mcneice is not married to Mr Fagan, but the pair have at least one child together, a daughter, eight . At Mr Lornie's home his wife of 27 years Kay, 55, answered the door. She said Billy’s post 'did not come as a surprise', but declined to say more according to the Daily Record. Mr Fagan, who has an eight-year-old daughter with Miss McNeice, also refused to say more, but posted on Facebook, telling friends: 'All is fine here thanks guys. My good pal Glen (Livet) is sorting the day out fabulously.' A Scouts spokeswoman said: 'Scouts Scotland was made aware of a posting on a local Scout Group's website that caused offence and immediate steps were taken to ensure that the inappropriate posting was removed.

Timothy Wiltsey went missing at a carnival at Kennedy Park in New Jersey in May of 1991, sparking a nationwide search. His partial remains were discovered in April the following year at Raritan Center, an industrial site at Edison, New Jersey. Scroll down for video . Michelle Lodzinski (left) has been arrested and charged with murder more than 20 years after her son, Timothy Wiltsey (right) went missing at a carnival in New Jersey . More than 20 years later, police have arrested his mother Michelle Lodzinski at an address in Jensen Beach, Florida, following a routine review of the cold case. According to reports at the time, Lodzinski, 47, took her son to a carnival in 1991 and allowed her son to ride on some of the attractions. At the time, it was reported that he asked for a drink and after she turned her back, he had disappeared. The carnival was closed down while a frantic search took place, but he could not be found. In the days that followed his desperate relatives and family friends organised several searches in the South Amboy area. As the appeal for information intensified, thousands of rail workers were handed flyers while his face was shown on big screens at major sporting fixtures. But police became suspicious after no one at the carnival saw a youngster matching Timothy's description. More than two decades later, a grand jury in Middlesex County has indicted her on a first-degree murder charge. Lodzinski . was arrested Wednesday evening around 6 p.m in Jensen Beach, Florida . after leaving work at the law firm, according to Master Sgt. Frank . Sabol, a Port St. Lucie police spokesman. Lodzinski . was in her car and headed over to her sister's house in Jensen Beach . when she was pulled over and detained. 'She was arrested without . incident,' Sabol said. 'She didn't put up a struggle.' A . New Jersey prosecutor said in a statement that the new information that . led to her arrest arose out of a cold case review of the boy's unsolved . 1991 disappearance. 'Following . a routine, cold case review of the evidence and facts surrounding the . disappearance and murder of Timothy Wiltsey, a new investigation was . conducted and the matter was presented to the grand jury,' Middlesex . County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey said in a statement released Thursday. The . grand jury charged that Lodzinski “did purposely or knowingly kill . Timothy Wiltsey, or did purposely or knowingly inflict serious bodily . injury upon Timothy Wiltsey, resulting in his death…,' according to . Carey. Sabol . said that Port St. Lucie police have been assisting New Jersey . prosecutors on the case since at least 2012 - sitting in on witness . interviews, executing search warrants and navigating the local court . system, but declined to divulge further details. Lodzinski, . who lives with two other sons, 12 and 16, in Port St. Lucie, 'hadn't . been on our radar until a couple years ago, when we were contacted by . New Jersey [prosecutors],' Sabol said. 'I checked our [St. Lucie County] jail records and we are not coming up with anything for her in this county,' he said. Her . bail was set at $2million though and it is not yet clear whether she . will waive an extradition hearing and return to New Jersey. Fellow employees at a civil litigation firm where Lodzinski works were 'stunned' to learn of her arrest. 'Everybody . here was certainly surprised, stunned and saddened,' said an employee . of GARY, WILLIAMS, PARENTI, WATSON & GARY, P.L, who requested . anonymity in return for speaking freely. 'The shocking thing is that her two sons are just these amazing, lovely children. She was a proud, doting mom to them,' the source said, adding that the two boys had occasionally visited their mother at work. 'Who would have ever known...' the source said, before going silent for a moment. 'Unbelievable.' The firm handles civil litigation, including medical malpractice, personal injury and wrongful death cases. 'We . had no knowledge of any of this,' the source told MailOnline on . Thursday morning. 'She came to work every day, but we had really no . knowledge of any other - certainly of this particular incident - but in . any other incidents that she was involved in.' Police arrested Michelle Lodzinski at an address in Jensen Beach, Florida, following a routine review of the cold case involving the death of her son . A grand jury in Middlesex County has indicted Michelle Lodzinski on a first-degree murder charge . The colleague said Lodzinski never made mention of her missing son, or her 1995 guilty plea after claiming the previous year that she herself was abducted by FBI agents. Lodzinski also pled guilty in 1998 to stealing a former employer's computer. 'She does have two kids, I know, in Port St. Lucie,' the colleague said, but Lodzinski divulged very little at work about her personal life. Kori Searcy, spokeswoman for the law firm, said Lodzinski has long been a member of the Stuart, Florida legal community, and has worked for at least three other area law firms since the mid-1990s. Retired New Jersey judge Alan A. Rockoff, who was Middlesex County Prosecutor in 1991, said the disappearance was a heartbreaking unsolved case that has been 'bugging' him for years. 'It’s gratifying to know that you’re suspicions were warranted in cases like this,' he said on Thursday. 'You grow a tough skin in law enforcement work, and I’ve been doing it for a lot of years, not only as prosecutor but a criminal judge. 'But when you have a young child with a face like Timmy Wiltsey,' he said, sighing deeply, 'you can never forget it.' Rockoff said that despite suspicions, investigators could not nail down sufficient evidence for an arrest back in 1991. 'There were several factors that more than satisfied us that we were looking at the right suspect,' Rockoff said. 'Her inconsistencies [in her story], some of the actual observations that were made [by investigators], some of her associations and the fact that some of the associates wouldn’t talk to us – all made us confident we were moving in the right direction.' 'Acknowledging the presumption of innocence and the state’s burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt, it’s a step in the right direction. I’m pleased that this case wasn’t put in a back shelf to gather dust.' He declined to speculate on what evidence may have prompted Lodzinski’s arrest.

British Airways is following its budget rivals by charging passengers to check in their baggage on short-haul flights. The airline announced a £10 fee to put luggage in the hold on some of its routes from Heathrow and London City. It will come into effect later this month on flights to Amsterdam, Barcelona, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paris, Rome, Rotterdam and Stockholm. Budget: British Airways passengers will soon be able to fly from London Heathrow and City airports on a 'no-frills' hand-luggage only ticket . BA said it is making short-haul . flights cheaper for those who do not want to fly with hold luggage, but . denied that it had been forced to change its fares structure to compete . with budget airlines. ‘We are basically offering the fare to adapt to travellers’ requirements and to give them what they want,’ said a spokesman. The charge follows a trial over the summer on short-haul routes from Gatwick, where BA faces strong competition from easyJet. Many . airlines now impose add-on charges for services including baggage, . food, seat reservations, priority boarding, fast-track security or seats . with more legroom. These now comprise up to 5 per cent of airlines’ total income, compared with less than 1 per cent five years ago. Saving time and money: Not only will passengers save themselves £10, but they might also avoid the queue to check larger items of luggage into the hold . Robin . Glover-Faure, BA head of short haul, said: ‘The hand-baggage-only fare . at Gatwick has proved popular with customers, so we’re now introducing . it on a selected number of short-haul routes from Heathrow and London . City. ‘If it proves as successful, we plan to roll it out across the whole short-haul network in the coming months.’ EasyJet charges between £9 and £19 for bags checked into the hold. Bags weighing more than 20kg cost customers flying with Ryanair £25. But . beware. If they do chose to take a bag to be checked in at the airport . after having booked a hand-luggage only ticket, passengers will pay an . additional £40 to stow their case. Competition: The move will see BA rival cheaper alternative carriers such as easyJet . The move will not affect long-haul flights, where BA faces strong competition from airlines offering larger baggage allowances. Aviation consultant John Strickland said BA needs to show that its no-baggage fares are competitive with low-cost carriers. Ironically, Luton-based easyJet appeared to move in the opposite direction to BA last week by launching an 'inclusive fare' that includes seat assignment and a checked in bag in the price.","Tickets on offer from Heathrow and City airports with a £10 discount .

The new layer has been dubbed the Dua's layer, after Professor Harminder Dua who discovered it, reports journal Ophthalmology. Professor Dua said: ""This is a major discovery that will mean that ophthalmology textbooks will literally need to be re-written. Having identified this new and distinct layer deep in the tissue of the cornea, we can now exploit its presence to make operations much safer and simpler for patients. Professor Harminder Dua at the University of Nottingham discovered the previously undetected layer . 'From a clinical perspective, there are many diseases that affect the back of the cornea which clinicians across the world are already beginning to relate to the presence, absence or tear in this layer.' Scientists previously believed the cornea to be comprised of five layers, from front to back, the corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer, the corneal stroma, Descemet's membrane and the corneal endothelium. The new layer that has been discovered is located at the back of the cornea between the corneal stroma and Descemet's membrane. Although it is just 15 microns thick - the entire cornea is around 550 microns thick or 0.5mm - it is incredibly tough and is strong enough to be able to withstand one and a half to two bars of pressure. Researchers proved the layer existed by simulating human corneal transplants and grafts on eyes donated for research. During these experiments, tiny bubbles of air were injected into the cornea to separate the different layers. The scientists then subjected the separated layers to electron microscopy, allowing them to study them at many thousand times their actual size and revealing Dua's layer. The authors say that the discovery will have an impact on advancing understanding of a number of diseases of the cornea, including acute hydrops, Descematocele and pre-Descemet's dystrophies . The scientists now believe that corneal hydrops, a bulging of the cornea caused by fluid build up that occurs in patients with keratoconus (conical deformity of the cornea), is caused by a tear in the Dua layer, through which water from inside the eye rushes in and causes waterlogging.","Nottingham researchers found the new layer - which is just 0.001 mm thick - within .

22,374,"Ecstatic at discovering she was pregnant, Hannah Sanders set off to drive to her parents’ house to tell them. But just 30 minutes after finding out she was expecting her first child, the 20-year-old was killed at the wheel of her Renault Clio in a collision with a pensioner’s car. Her fiance Lee Palmer, 26, a passenger in her car, died at the scene. The couple had just collected the keys to a new flat and were looking forward to a happy future together. Hannah Sanders, 20, had only just found out she was pregnant- and had just collected the keys to a new flat with her fiancé Lee Palmer (pictured together) - when the crash occurred on the B269 in Limpsfield, Surrey . Miss Sanders, from Oxted, Surrey, only discovered she was expecting a baby half an hour before the crash . In a heartbreaking interview after the tragedy, Miss Sanders’s mother Pat, 59, and father David, 52, a construction manager, told how they discovered the pregnancy when police gave them a printout of the messages their daughter had posted on an online forum for mothers-to-be. After taking a home pregnancy test and announcing the news, her last message at 1.15pm said: ‘I still won’t be 100 per cent convinced till I have like 30 lines lol x.’ Her mother said: ‘We couldn’t believe it. Hannah was so obviously thrilled and there were so many messages of congratulations – poignantly, some were even being posted after she’d died. ‘But then as news of the deaths spread, people began posting RIP condolences.’ An inquest at Surrey Coroner’s Court heard how Miss Sanders and Mr Palmer picked up the keys to their new home on the day they died – April 25 this year. It was raining when Miss Sanders lost control of her car on a corner and skidded across the road, straight into the path of a Toyota Hilux driven by Rita Heath at 1.45pm. Mrs Heath, 75, who will not face prosecution, told the inquest in Woking she saw the Clio ‘slide’ across the B269 road in Surrey, where the speed limit was 60mph, before the two vehicles crashed into each other. The fatal crash occurred in wet conditions on the B269 in Limpsfield, Surrey, on April 25 (file picture) ‘The motor came round the bend and slid across the road. I looked and thought, “My God, they are on my side of the road”.’ She said there was ‘no way’ she could have avoided the car, adding: ‘It was over in seconds.’ Assistant Surrey coroner Simon Wickens recorded a conclusion of road traffic collision in the deaths of Miss Sanders and Mr Palmer, both of whom sustained multiple injuries. Mr Wickens said: ‘Hannah was struggling to control her car at the time. It would have been a fast-moving incident. ‘There was very little more Rita Heath could do. In reality, we shall never know the reason Hannah lost control’. Speaking before the inquest, Miss Sanders’s mother said: ‘It’s tragic that she and Lee never got to tell us their wonderful news. They would have been so happy and excited. ‘Being a mum and marrying Lee was all Hannah ever wanted.’","Hannah Sanders found out she was pregnant 30 minutes before fatal crash .

23,427,"They call Pele the greatest of all time and most of the world agrees. Many here in Brazil call Garrincha even greater that Pele because he played football with the rhythmic soul of the samba nation and personified the spirit of the beautiful game. They call Ronaldo the Phenomenon because how he ever came back on crippled legs to win one of their five World Cups so far and thus become the leading goalscorer in the history of the these Finals defies mortal rationalisation. Samba magic: Neymar has scored four goals at this World Cup to fire Brazil into the last 16 . Finisher: Following his double against Cameroon, Neymar has 37 goals in 53 internationals for Brazil . VIDEO Neymar better than Pele . Age: 22 (D.O.B. 05/02/1992) Born: Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil . Position: Forward . Clubs: Santos (2009-13), Barcelona (2013-) International debut: August 10, 2010 vs USA . International caps: 53 . First international goal: August 10, 2010 vs USA . International goals: 37 . They don’t know what to call Neymar. Not yet. But what they do suspect is that they may, just may, have found Brazil’s successor to the legend of Edson Arantes do Nascimento. If Neymar da Silva Santos Junior is the next Pele then we are watching it happen at this World Cup. What makes this all the more possible – not to mention so thrilling that we hardly dare believe it – is that this young man refuses to countenance any such comparison. ‘Pele is a god,’ he says. ‘I’m a footballer.’ You have to love a boy - he is still only 22 - who insists on having Neymar Jr inscribed on the back of that imperishable yellow shirt in reverence of his father. No that his football playing dad ever scored a goal of genius like the first of the two he put past Cameroon to ensure that the host nation dazzle on to the last 16 of the first World Cup played in this spiritual home of the beautiful game since 1950. But it speaks of respect. Looking up: Arguably only Pele and Garrincha now stand ahead of Neymar in the list of Brazilian greats . Poise: Neymar readies himself to score Brazil's opening goal against Cameroon in their 4-1 World Cup victory . 1) Pele - 77 goals (92 caps) 2) Zico - 66 goals (88 caps) 3) Ronaldo - 62 goals (98 caps) 4) Romario - 55 goals (70 caps) 5) Bebeto - 39 goals (75 caps) 6) Neymar - 37 goals (53 caps) Neymar has already had with a former girlfriend a son, who he vows will always be central to his life, plus a tabloid affair with a glamourous TV celebrity. Yet he remains the fresh-faced lad every Brazilian mother would love her daughter to bring home for dinner. Yet there is a feisty edge to this personality which is reminiscent, also, of the icon whose boots he is being called upon to fill. Pele could look after himself on the pitch if put to the intimidation. Similarly, when a Cameroon heavy gave him a gratuitous and potentially wounding shove into the cameramen and their heavy equipment, Neymar brushed away the false hand of apology and promptly sent his assailant and his team=mates on their way home with another defeat. We will come to recall many moments when Neymar convinced of his greatness but that will remain one of mine. Along, of course, with the goals and the wondrous touches of skill. The magic is beginning to enchant the watching world, especially as it its couched within his boyish charm. Reverence: The 22-year-old insists on having 'Neymar Jr' on his back, such is his respect for his father . The best: Pele is widely regarded as Brazil's greatest ever player but Neymar is now making his mark . Treble: Pele won three World Cups and Neymar is hoping to inspire Brazil to their sixth triumph . He scores, four times already on his way to what may be his winning of the Golden Boot at this World Cup. He winks cheekily. He smiles. He mingles with the Brazilian people as if he is still simply one of their own. In that, he is more reminiscent of Garrincha than Pele. For that, they love him all the more. But in the reckoning it is the exquisite ability that counts. In a game increasingly populated by men of muscle and power, he is a wraith wrapped around silken skills. In that he reminds me of George Best, a will o’ the wisp with the courage to deliver his talent. I defer to no-one in my worship of the pantheon of Brazilian footballers but in my estimation Neymar is close to superceding most of them... Zico, Falcao, Didi, Vava, Jairzinho, Rivellino, Romario and Ronaldinho included. Time will be the judge, of course. But he is so good that the modern generation have a discussion in which to engage which is of their time. The tendency has been to propose Lionel Messsi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the current pretenders to the thrones of not only Pele and Co but Diego Maradona, Alfredo di Stefano and Johan Cruyff. Class: Arguably only Garrincha (left) and Pele now stand ahead of Neymar in Brazil's all-time great list . Both are marvellous player but Neymar brings something all the more valid to the debate. Messi tends to operate on the wide right so as to cut in onto this wand of a  left foot and Ronaldo is inclined to work the left flank in readiness for angling in onto his potent right. But Neymar works where it hurts, where it can do the most damage, where it really matters. Through the middle. That is how he has come to play 53 games for his country at such a tender age, scoring 37 goals in the process. That is why he just might win this World Cup for Brazil. That is why he is climbing so quickly through the ranks of greatness. I would suggest that only two giants remain for him to elevate himself above - Pele and Garrincha. That enormous task does not appear to be beyond him. It will take more than one World Cup to make it happen but if he works his magic here, he could well be on his way to immortality. Perhaps, one day, he will be talked of not as the new Pele - but as the first Neymar. VIDEO Neymar will handle the pressure - Ronaldo .

24,72,"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:43 PM on 5th August 2011 . A mother regained consciousness in hospital today to be told the tragic news that her husband and two children had been killed in an arson attack at their home. Angela Sharkey's husband Thomas, 55, eight-year-old daughter Bridget and 21-year-old son, also called Thomas, died after the attack on their flat in Helensburgh, near Glasgow on July 24. Mrs Sharkey, 46, who had been sedated after suffering serious burns, was given the grim news by her sister Margaret McKenchie after she came round in a ward at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary. Sole survivor: Angela Sharkey awoke in hospital to be told her husband and two children had been killed in an Arson attack . Ms McKenchie said: 'There was such sadness in her eyes and I can't begin to explain how shattered she is by this terrible, terrible news. 'We're absolutely heartbroken at the deaths of young Thomas, Bridget and of course their dad Tommy as well. 'She was totally and utterly devastated to hear from me that her two lovely young children had been taken from her. 'Her family was her life and she has been robbed of any future with them. It's so, so sad that she will never see young Thomas and Bridget grow up.' Close family: A holiday photo of Angela Sharkey with her eight-year old daughter Bridget and 21-year-old son Thomas . Police have launched a triple murder investigation with a 55-strong team of officers working on the case. The fire broke out in the living room of the flat at around 5.10am on July 24 and quickly spread. Strathclyde Police said the building had just one door and the family became trapped by the flames. The heat of the blaze caused a downstairs window to explode and left an area of severe scorching around the front door of the property in Scott Court. Mr Sharkey Senior was seen hanging out of the window and shouting for help. His son was found dead at the scene. The rest of the family were taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley where Bridget died a short time later. Mr Sharkey and his wife both suffered serious burns and were moved to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where he died on July 30. Ms McKechnie added: 'On behalf of my sister Angela I would like to ask anyone please, please if you have any information, don't be afraid to come forward to the police to help us solve this horrible crime.' Thomas junior, an extremely talented golfer, was in the country after returning home from the U.S. where he had a Golfing Scholarship at Georgia Southern University. In his biography on the Georgia Southern Eagles website, he described himself as 'ambitious and competitive', adding that his grandfather and father were the biggest influence on his athletics career for teaching him golf. His sister Bridget is believed to have died after coming home from a planned sleepover because she missed her parents. Police said they are keen to speak to people who were at two parties which took place near Scott Court on the night of the blaze. The parties went on into the early hours of the morning. They are also keen to speak to two men seen in the vicinity at around 5am. A man in a grey hooded top was seen crossing West Princes Street near James Street at about 5am and another man was seen going on to John Street between 4am and 5am. Police are examining CCTV collected from around the Argyll and Bute town and are visiting more than 500 houses and business premises. Detective Superintendent Peter McPike . said: ""There are no suspects at the moment. Clearly we are really . desperate to find out why this has taken place. 'Perhaps once we can establish that we will be closer to finding a suspect.' Family members (left to right) Margaret McKechnie, Gemma McFadyen and Val McFayden appeal to to the public for information during a police press conference . He added: 'I don't think people in Helensburgh are holding back. I do think that perhaps there might be a small number of people who might well be in receipt of information that could be crucial to the investigation and I would appeal to the consciences of those people to come forward and to contact us.' He said that police will wait until medical staff give approval before they speak to Mrs Sharkey, whose condition is still critical. Valerie McFadyen, 51, Thomas Sharkey Senior's sister, said: 'These murders have torn our family apart and it is something that no family should ever have to go through. It is very hard to come to terms with this. 'Someone knows who carried out this appalling act, and we do not understand how anyone could protect this killer who has murdered three members of our family. We would urge people to please look at your conscience and make that vital call to police to help us. 'We would like to thank people for their messages of condolence and help. But please keep doing all that you can to help police and help find those responsible.' Crimestoppers has put up a £10,000 reward for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of whoever committed the crime. The email address for the investigation is operationendeavour@strathclyde.pnn.police.uk. Officers have also set up an additional phone number for the incident room.

26,51,"You might expect polar bears, the Artic Circle's apex predators, to be dab hands at dancing on ice. But as this specimen in Svalbard shows, even after thousands of years of evolutionary adaptation, some still suffer from two-left feet on the frozen ocean. Heinrich Eggenfellner, a 49-year-old videographer from Norway, said: 'I have encountered polar bears many times every year since I live up here and am used to them. 'This episode, however, was extraordinary.' Born slippy: A polar walks across thin sea ice in Svalbard, Norway, where it was caught on camera looking very unsteady on its feet as it made its way across the slippery surface . Spreading its weight: The polar bear does its best not to collapse through the fragile ice by spreading out . In its element: The beast finally gave up and pushed a hole in the ice to dive into the freezing water . Mr Eggenfellner and his friend Svein Wik spent hours in Norway's northernmost territory hunting for a polar bear to film and photograph, then hours more waiting for the slumbering beast to wake up. It was time well spent. The patient duo were treated to a farcical display of slipping and sliding across the frozen sea, with their subject falling flat on its face at least once. 'Maybe we waited 3-4 hours before the bear woke up and came out onto thinner and thinner ice,' Mr Wik told Caters News Agency. 'At one point, it spread out on all four legs to prevent falling thorough the ice until finally the bear gave up, pushed through the ice and started to swim. 'He dived for a few seconds and showed up again, looking up and then started to shake of the water.' Proud: Polar bears are the Arctic Circle's apex predators and have adapted to the habitat over millennia . Evolution: Regarded as marine mammals because of the many months they spend at sea, polar bears have nevertheless adapted large, flat paws to distribute their bulk as they pad across thin ice . Brains: However this beast seems to have realised that big feet are not enough to stop it smashing through the thin ice and is trying to spread its weight to lessen the pressure beneath it . Weighty: Polar bears can weigh up to 1,100lbs, more than enough to smash through thin layers of frozen sea . Taking a dip: The polar bear pictured just after deciding it was better off taking a swim in the freezing sea .

I think the Polar bear is one of the most charismatic animals in the world. 'It was a rare and very interesting situation to watch everything and this was, without doubt, the ultimate wilderness experience for me.'

27,316,"By . Associated Press . A former U.S. Marine convicted of criminal charges in Iran after being accused of working for the CIA will appeal for a new trial after already seeing his sentence reduced once, an Iranian news agency reported on Sunday. Amir Hekmati, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen born in Arizona, was arrested in August 2011, then tried, convicted and sentenced to death for spying. However, Iran's Supreme Court annulled the death sentence after Hekmati appealed, ordering a retrial in 2012. The country's Revolutionary Court then overturned his conviction for espionage, instead charging him with 'cooperating with hostile governments' and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. The former U.S. Marine, Amir Hekmati, convicted of criminal charges in Iran after being accused of working for the CIA will appeal for a new trial after already seeing his sentence reduced once . The Obama administration in November asked for Iran to free Hekmati and two other Americans believed held there, as relations recently have thawed between Washington and moderate President Hassan Rouhani (pictured) Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, Hekmati's lawyer, said he would appeal the 10-year prison sentence as well, according to a report by the semi-official ISNA news agency. ISNA quoted the lawyer saying the rehearing request comes over a possible mistake by the judge in the case and the 'inconsistency' between Hekmati's alleged crime and its punishment. Iranian law allows for hearings after an appeals court decision for those reasons. Tabatabaei said Hekmati has handed his request for rehearing to prison authorities. Iranian prosecutors said Hekmati received special training and served at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before heading to Iran as a spy. The Obama administration in November asked for Iran to free Hekmati and two other Americans believed held there, as relations recently have thawed between Washington and moderate President Hassan Rouhani.

His family, now in Michigan, says Hekmati is innocent and only went to Iran to visit his grandparents. The U.S. government repeatedly has denied the 31 year old is a spy. Previously, Tabatabaei said he sought Hekmati's conditional freedom from Evin prison, north of the capital, Tehran. Hekmati has been behind bars since his arrest. Conditional freedom could allow Hekmati to leave the country, depending on what a court decides. That could allow Hekmati to visit his father Ali Hekmati, a professor at Mott Community College in Flint, Michigan, who family members say has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and recently suffered a stroke. Tabatabaei said a doctor treating Hekmati's father at a U.S. hospital has sent him a letter asking the ex-Marine's leave on bail to meet his ailing father.","Amir Hekmati, a dual U.S.-Iranian .

28,240,"Michael Grimm, a Republican who has represented New Yorkers in Congress since 2011, plans to enter a guilty plea Tuesday in federal court, admitting that he helped prepare a fraudulent tax return for a restaurant he partially owned. The federal felony could bring him up to three years in prison, but a person who is familiar with the congressman's negotiations told DailyMail.com on Monday that the congressman doesn't expect to go to prison. Grimm is a former FBI agent and is a rare Republican in the Democrat-friendly Big Apple. His fate will be up to Federal Judge Pamela Chen, however, when she hears the terms of a plea agreement. Grimm was originally charged with 20 separate federal crimes and has been serving his constituents while under the terms of a $400,000 bond granted in the spring. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE CRIMINAL INDICTMENT . ON HIS WAY OUT? New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday to a federal tax felony . Grimm maintained his innocence throughout the 2014 congressional campaign season but will cop to a crime now that he's won re-election . Loretta Lynch, the sitting U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., brought the indictment against Grimm this year making him the first federal lawmaker to face criminal charges since 2008. Lynch later became President Barack Obama choice to succeed Eric Holder as U.S. attorney general. By pleading guilty to a single tax charge, he will avoid a trial that was scheduled to convene in January. Jurors would heave heard details of Grimm's alleged scheme to hide more than $1 million of his restaurant's sales and wages in order to dodge taxes between 2008 and 2010. He was also accused of hiring illegal immigrants to work for him. The plea hearing is scheduled for 1:00 p.m. Tuesday in a Brooklyn federal courtroom. Neither prosecutors nor Grimm's attorney has commented for the record. The person who spoke to DailyMail.com, and two others who talked to the Associated Press, said Grimm will enter a guilty plea on a single count of 'aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of a false or fraudulent tax return.' The Staten Island Republican easily won re-election in November despite campaigning under a cloud of suspicion for nearly five months. He beat Democrat Domenic Recchia by a 55-42 per cent margin to win a third term in office. If Grimm avoids a prison sentence, the shoulder-chipped GOPer is expected to argue that he should remain in office during a period of probation. That decision, however, will depend on the leanings of his fellow House Republicans, who hold a sizable majority and could vote to expel him. The House Ethics Committee has let its own investigation idle while the wheels of justice turn. But if he admits to a crime on Tuesday, the committee could quickly move to throw him out of Congress. House Speaker John Boehner's office kept mum on Monday, declining to speculate to DailyMail.com about Grimm's prospects to keep his job. Grimm owned a 45-percent interest in 'Granny Sayz,' a company that did business as Healthalicious, a Manhattan health food restaurant. Lynch's indictment accused him of helping the company avoid paying taxes on more than $1 million in income, and using cash to underpay workers under the table. Some of those employees were allegedly illegal immigrants and earned less than the minimum wage. The government alleged that Grimm kept two separate payroll ledgers, one of which was fictitious, allowing him to skirt income taxes, payroll taxes and workers' compensation costs. When some of the employees sued the company for back wages, Grimm was deposed under oath. Prosecutors claim he testified, falsely, that he had never paid the restaurant's workers in cash. In January, Grimm became a household name when a New York City journalist caught him on video threatening to throw him off a U.S. Capitol balcony for asking him a tough question about an unrelated federal probe into his 2010 campaign finances. Grimm posted a $400,000 bond to remain free while tax fraud charges pended against him in a case revolving around alleged illegal cash payments he made to illegal-immigrant restaurant employees in order to avoid paying taxes . Grimm went ballistic when NY1 reporter Michael Scotto strayed away from the approved interview topics after President Obama's State of the union Speech on January 28. The congressman waled out of range of the camera suddenly when the topic came up, saying he didn't want to speak 'off-topic.' Michael Scotto, a video journalist for the NY1 television station, was on the receiving end of a Grimm threat in January at the US Capitol . Grimm 'does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances,' Scotto said, closing his televised segment. But the camera kept rolling as the congressman barked. 'Let me be clear to you,' he said. 'You ever do that to me again I’ll throw you off this f***ing balcony.' 'Why? It’s a valid question,' Scotto responded. 'No, no, you’re not man enough, you’re not man enough,' Grimm sniped back. 'I’ll break you in half. Like a boy.' Grimm apologized the following day. His long-time girlfriend, Diana Durand, pleaded guilty in September to illegally funneling money to his campaign by paying 'straw donors' to make the contributions. In some cases she reimbursed them after the fact. The scheme obscured where the donated money originally came from and allowed Grimm to reap more of Durand's campaign cash than the law allowed. Conservative filmmaker Dinesh D-Souza pleaded guilty to the same crime in May. He paid his friends back for their donations to college friend Wendy Long's failed U.S. senate campaign.

Taarabt has featured just three times for QPR this season and was loaned out last season to both Fulham and AC Milan.

Adel Taarabt (left, with Armand Traore, Eduardo Vargas and Mauricio Isla) posted this  before the Reds game .

The 25-year-old was on loan at AC Milan last season (left) and has been playing for QPR reserves (right) Redknapp blasted Taarabt, who posted pictures on Instagram before and after the Liverpool game, as he explained his omission, saying: 'He's not injured. He's not fit. He's not fit to play football unfortunately. He played in a reserve game the other day and I could have run about more than he did. 'I pick people who want to try, who come in every day and work, train and show a good attitude. When he starts doing that, if he ever can, maybe he'll get a game. I can't protect people who don't want to run and train, and are about three stone overweight.' 'What am I supposed to say? Keep getting your 60, 70 grand a week and don't train?'

Roughly... 21 bags of sugar . 39 pints of beer . The UK's biggest hamburger . Colombia's fattest baby . 'It was a bit of naivety,' said Redknapp. 'When you have a free-kick in shooting range you have to decide what to do. 'There's no point getting loads of men forward if you're going to shoot, as you'll get caught at the back. 'You have to get organised, and not get done on the counter-attack.' Despite the loss, Redknapp, who lost Sandro (groin) and Nedum Onuoha (hamstring) to injuries, was optimistic about his side's display. The QPR manager's position has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks, but he said: 'There isn't anyone who could do any better here than me.'

30,291,"(CNN) -- Relationship breakdowns can happen to anyone -- even to cities. After nearly 20 years of building ties with their ""sister city"" of St. Petersburg, Russia, leaders in Lansing, Michigan, have found a key sticking point -- Russia's clampdown on discussion of gay issues. The city council in Michigan's capital voiced its concerns over Russian anti-gay policies on Monday by adopting a resolution calling for an end to the ""sister cities"" relationship with St. Petersburg. Local news site MLive.com reported that the vote was unanimous. Russia has been drawing controversy for a recently enacted law that bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere that children could overhear. City council member Jody Washington first brought the matter before the city council during a meeting last month. Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero had issued a statement saying that while he opposes the ""oppression of the LGBT community in Russia,"" he also hopes to maintain the relationship with St. Petersburg, which began in 1994 with a Russian-language high school exchange program. ""I encourage the city council and the commission to issue a resolution condemning the violence and discrimination in Russia,"" Bernero said. ""We must denounce the bigotry, but we should not sever the sister city relationship, because we have the potential for progressive dialogue between citizens."" Meanwhile, a local agency said Tuesday there's really no relationship to sever, according to MLive.com. Lansing Regional Sisters Commission President Barbara Roberts Mason said it was only one district within St. Petersburg that was the sister city for Lansing, and that ""ceased abruptly"" when the governmental structure of St. Petersburg changed years ago. But the issue that triggered Monday's council vote is just one reflection from an international spotlight that is being cast on Russia ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi early next year. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the anti-gay law, which took effect last month. It has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory. Gay rights group All Out delivered a 320,000-signature petition to the International Olympic Committee headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, earlier this month. The petition urges the IOC to condemn the law and urges Russia to ensure the security of all visitors, athletes and Russian people before, during, and after the Games. The IOC said that it had ""received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games.""","Lansing's city council votes to end ""sister cities"" relationship with St. Petersburg, Russia .

31,332,"By . Larisa Brown . Two police firearms officers are being investigated over claims they killed an injured deer with a crowbar. The officers had been sent to humanely destroy the animal after it was hit by a vehicle. But instead of using the weapons they were carrying – as expected in the situation – they instead decided to use a crowbar to bludgeon the stricken deer to death. Taken out of its misery: A deer like the one beaten to death by two Durham police officers . Durham Police said the officers had been trained to humanely kill large animals as part of their duties and had no explanation as to why they chose the unorthodox method. The force confirmed it was investigating the incident, adding that the deer was ‘apparently not destroyed in a humane manner’. Animal rights charities said the officers should be ‘locked up’ if an investigation found they did beat the deer to death unnecessarily. A member of the pubic called police after the deer was found knocked over in Tanfield Lea, County Durham, in June. Police would usually ask a vet to deal with the animal, but as one could not reach the scene quickly enough, an armed response unit was sent instead. But rather than following procedure and using their firearms to end the deer’s suffering as quickly as possible, they used a crowbar. The approved method of humane destruction, according to the police, is to authorise the crew in an armed response vehicle to use their weapons to shoot the injured animal so that the death is as clean and quick as possible. Amply equipped for the job: Durham Police said the officers had been trained to humanely kill large animals as part of their duties and had no explanation as to why they chose the unorthodox method . Officers have to be given authority to use their weapons by a duty inspector. The incident only came to light after other officers, who were not present at the time, were made aware of what had happened. It was reported to senior officers earlier this month and the pair involved have been moved to other duties while an investigation is carried out. They could face a misconduct hearing or criminal charges. Yesterday a spokesman for animal rights group Peta said: ‘If it turns out that police officers did, in fact, bludgeon a deer to death, they should be not only struck off, but also locked up.’ A spokesman for Durham Police said: ‘It is not unusual for firearms officers to be deployed on occasions when a deer, or other large animal, is clearly suffering as the result of being struck by a vehicle and the best action would be for the animal to be humanely destroyed. ‘We can confirm inquiries are being made to establish the circumstances surrounding the destruction of an injured deer on a road in Tanfield Lea in early June. ‘It has been brought to our attention that the deer was apparently not destroyed in the approved, humane manner.’ An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘This sounds like a terrible incident and we await the conclusion of the police investigation.’","Police were sent to dispatch the deer after it was hit by a car in Tanfield Lea .

32,424,"(CNN)Lesley Gore, whose No. 1 hit ""It's My Party"" kicked off a successful singing career while she was still in high school, has died. She was 68. Her death was confirmed by family friend Blake Morgan, who produced her 2005 album, ""Ever Since."" ""We loved her and we are very sad. She was an incredibly powerful, incredibly beautiful talent,"" he said. According to People magazine, the cause of death was cancer. Gore, born Lesley Sue Goldstein, had just turned 17 when ""It's My Party,"" produced by Quincy Jones, topped the charts in June 1963. The song, about a girl whose party is ruined when she catches her boyfriend, Johnny, with a rival, became a pop classic, its catchy chorus often imitated. She was an overnight success, with fans suddenly converging on her family's house in Tenafly, New Jersey. ""When the disc jockey ... would say, 'That was Lesley Gore, the sweetie pie from Tenafly,' well, people just came to Tenafly. You know, I'd wake up and there were people camped out on the grass,"" she said in an interview, according to Biography.com. The follow-ups, ""Judy's Turn to Cry"" and ""She's a Fool,"" were in a similar teen-love vein, but Gore's next hit, ""You Don't Own Me,"" was something else entirely. ""You Don't Own Me,"" also produced by Jones, was a dramatic assertion of independence and pride. Released in late 1963, it peaked at No. 2, kept out of the top spot by the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand."" Over the years the song, written by John Madara and Dave White, became a feminist anthem, recorded by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Joan Jett. During the 2012 presidential campaign, a number of celebrities -- including Lena Dunham, Tavi Gevinson and Carrie Brownstein -- appeared in a commercial lip-synching the song in an effort to urge women to vote. ""It's hard for me to believe but we're still fighting for the same things we were then,"" Gore wrote on her Facebook page in 2012. ""Yes, ladies, we've got to come together and get out there and vote and protect our bodies. They're ours. Please vote."" The political activism suited Gore. After her singing career started winding down in the late '60s, she volunteered for Robert Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. She later worked for New York politician Bella Abzug and such projects as a Bronx community health organization, healthpeople.org. ""I worked for people like Robert Kennedy and I thought: 'Wow, that's what it's about. That's how you change the world,' "" she told The New York Times in 2005. She also did some acting, playing Pussycat, a Catwoman sidekick, on the TV series ""Batman."" As an adult Gore came out publicly as a lesbian, though she told the website AfterEllen.com she never tried to hide her sexuality. ""I just never found it was necessary because I really never kept my life private. Those who knew me, those who worked with me, were well aware,"" she said in 2005. ""Times were very different then, so, you know, I just tried to live as normally as humanly possible. But as truthfully as humanly possible."" She had some songwriting success with a tune she co-wrote with her brother Michael, ""Out Here on My Own,"" a song from the 1980 film ""Fame"" that was nominated for an Oscar, but she went almost 30 years before releasing an album of new material in 2005. ""Ever Since,"" a low-key collection of songs, was ""very sparse, very organic,"" Gore told The New York Times. She had continued to perform, however, always ready to trot out ""It's My Party"" and her other hits. ""If I've learned anything in this business, how stupid would it be not to do 'It's My Party' when people come to hear it?"" she said.

35,41,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber must pay $80,900 restitution for damage caused to his former neighbor's mansion by eggs he threw. The pop star accepted a plea deal to settle a vandalism charge that puts him on probation for two years. The probation will be supervised until he completes 12 weekly anger management sessions, works five days of community labor and pays the restitution. The sentence also requires Bieber to stay at least 100 yards way from the victim's family. Bieber must let the probation officer know if he is deported or otherwise leaves the country, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Leland Harris said. ""Justin is glad to get this matter resolved and behind him,"" his representative said in a written statement. ""He will continue to move forward focusing on his career and his music."" The misdemeanor charge was filed Wednesday morning by the Los Angeles County District attorney five months after a sheriff's investigator recommended it be prosecuted as a felony. Assistant District Attorney Alan Yochelson told the judge that while the damage to Jeffrey Schwartz's ""dream house"" was ""incredible"" he did not think it warranted a felony charge. Yochelson called it ""an extremely immature and silly act"" that caused ""incredible amount of damage"" to what the neighbors considered their ""dream house."" Bieber's lawyer previously called it a ""silly prank."" Bieber, 20, was not required to be in court. Attorney Shawn Holley, known for her frequent appearances defending Lindsay Lohan, entered the ""no contest"" plea on his behalf in a Van Nuys, California, court Wednesday afternoon. Is Justin Bieber getting special treatment? The vandalism case is what lawyers call a ""wobbler,"" meaning the district attorney could have prosecuted it as a felony -- which would have much more serious consequences for the singer -- or as a misdemeanor. Bieber has since moved from the neighborhood, selling the mansion to Khloe Kardashian. Justin Bieber: 'Don't believe rumors' Bieber's drunken driving charge in Miami is also still pending, although a source close to that case said talks are under way to reach a plea deal to avoid a trial. Justin Bieber avoids felony robbery charge in cell phone 'tussle' Los Angeles prosecutors decided in June not to pursue charges against Bieber for an incident in which a Los Angeles woman accused him of trying to take her cell phone. Justin Bieber caught in racial controversy . The egging case began when the singer's neighbor called 911 to report that someone was throwing eggs over a fence from Bieber's home. Residents of the exclusive community had previously reported several incidents allegedly involving Bieber, including speeding on the residential streets. Investigators with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department searched Bieber's home on January 14 for video from Bieber's security cameras they hoped would show what happened. They later presented prosecutors of video they said supports a vandalism charge against Bieber, an investigator said.

36,290,"By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 12:54 EST, 2 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:24 EST, 2 October 2012 . Battle: For years Caroline Dowdall struggled with a phobia of vomit, so much so she would starve and drug her own children . A woman’s extreme fear of vomit led to her starving her young children in case food would make them sick. Caroline Dowdall would even give her three sons car sickness drugs before long journeys to ensure that they would not throw up. The 54-year-old’s emetophobia controlled her life during her sons’ childhoods as she was too scared to feed them more than a basic diet of rice, toast and the occasional boiled egg. Caroline’s battle with emetophobia - the irrational fear of vomit - began when she was eight and her pregnant aunt was sick on her during a car journey. ‘It . was a hot sticky day and I was horrified,’ Caroline explains. ‘It was . of course an accident but the smell repulsed me and after that I began . to actively avoid people who I thought might vomit.’ At . school she avoided pupils who had been off sick as well as the canteen, . which she considered a high risk area, and feared pregnant women. She . would cross the street if saw a woman she suspected was pregnant and as . she got older and her friends became pregnant she would simply cut them . out of her life. ‘I lost friends because it would be too stressful otherwise,’ she says. When Caroline herself fell pregnant at the age of 20, she lied to midwives to obtain medication to prevent her from . being sick. ‘I said I had terrible morning sickness, thankfully I hadn’t . but I wanted to take something to prevent me getting it.’ Despite warnings of side effects she took the medication throughout her pregnancy and gave birth to first son Anthony. She was a happy mother to a healthy baby boy, but it did not take long before the phobia took control of her parenting. ‘At first it was OK, the baby sick didn’t really smell of anything and there wasn’t much. The real anxiety came when it was time to wean him because I knew that once he was on solid food he would produce what I called “proper vomit.”’ Controlled: Caroline, pictured with her oldest sons Anthony and Philip,  was so terrified of vomit that she would not give her sons any food she thought might make them sick and they grew up on a diet of toast, rice and eggs . After pressure from her partner a reluctant Caroline agreed he should be on solids. ‘I only gave him food I was happy wouldn’t make him sick and tiny amounts too.’ It was the same routine when his brothers Philip and Tim were born. By then her first marriage had ended and Caroline had remarried, again managing to keep her phobia a secret. Dinner for her sons was often toast and occasionally a boiled egg. ‘It would break my heart when they asked for dessert as I considered sweet foods to pose the highest risk and so I always lied and said we didn’t have any. ‘If they wanted snacks I gave them crackers and other meals were limited to plain rice and chicken, easy to digest and always well cooked.’ Enough to survive: Caroline justified her children's low calorie intake of a few hundred a day with the argument that they had more than children in other parts of the world . Shockingly, Caroline also kept their portions tiny, fearing that overfeeding them could induce sickness. ‘They . were probably on just a few hundred calories a day. At most meal times . they would ask for more like Oliver Twist. It was awful. ‘It . broke my heart when they said their tummies hurt. I knew it was because . they were hungry but I was so scared of not being able to cope if they . were sick I never relented. ‘I knew they had enough to survive on and reasoned that they still ate more than a lot of children in the world.’ Thankfully her sons grew into healthy boys and in the mid-eighties Caroline attempted to seek help. But when she saw her GP she was ushered out of the door and in her desperation Caroline turned to alcohol to cope. ‘I was left to cope in the only way I knew how. On the rare occasion that any of her kids were sick she downed Brandy to give her the courage to clean it up. ‘I still couldn’t cuddle them or hold them in the way a mum should if they were sick. And I would swig alcohol believing it might stop me from catching whatever bug they had by killing the germs.’ Finally free: Caroline, pictured on holiday in Florida with her husband John, eventually began to deal with her phobia when she came clean to her family about her behaviour . Holidays were also a nightmare, as she could not bear to watch them on funfair rides and feared travel sickness. ‘Thankfully my parents were always keen to take them on holiday so I managed to avoid it most of the time.’ But when she did have to take the boys somewhere by car Caroline resorted to shocking methods to prevent sickness. ‘I would drug them with travel sickness pills that caused drowsiness. If they were asleep then they couldn’t vomit,’ she says. When they grew older she would pay them to take the drugs, despite them not even feeling sick. ‘Then they would close their eyes for the rest of the journey and I could relax and get us there without worrying.’ Coping: Caroline now lives in Spain and can enjoy meals in restaurants and time with her grandchildren without fear . Caroline . calls her actions during these years ‘truly awful and unspeakable . behaviour for a mother’ but says the phobia was in control of her life. ‘It’s very hard to distinguish right from wrong, you are just trying to get through the day in any way you can. ‘I loved them dearly and I didn’t want them taken off me.’ She says: ‘My phobia stopped me being a good mother. But I’m adamant that I will not let it stop me being a good grandmother. 'My sons are now old enough to understand why I acted the way I did when they were little.’ Eventually Caroline divorced again and met third husband John. By then two of her sons had become fathers and Caroline was already starting to avoid the babies through fear they would be sick. ‘I knew I had been a terrible mother and I didn’t want to repeat my mistakes but I could feel history was repeating. 'I was desperate to be a good grandmother and have my grandchildren come to stay but once again my fear was controlling my life.’ Eventually she broke down and admitted to her husband why she was so afraid of spending time with her grandchildren. ‘It was the first time anyone had listened and understood. He promised to help me and I don’t know it is simply a case of sharing the load, but since I started being honest with my family I feel more in control. ‘My family was relieved, my odd behaviour over the past 46 years finally made sense and I have said sorry to my sons. ‘I was determined fear would not stop me being a grandmother.' Now Caroline can spend time with her grandchildren and even enjoy a meal in a restaurant and has written a book about her journey. ‘There are other sufferers out there, and I want them to know they are not alone. ‘Now it’s still a struggle but it’s much easier. There’s a long way to go but I will get there.'","Caroline Dowdall kept her children on a strict diet of a few hundred calories a day to keep them from being sick .

39,360,"(CNN) -- Mobile World Congress returned to form this year, with Samsung, Sony, and Huawei all choosing to launch flagship devices in Barcelona. These are my picks from the show: . Nokia X . Just months after being sold to Microsoft, Nokia chose to launch its first Android phones. The devices, all dubbed Nokia X, will run Android but be packed with Microsoft services like OneDrive and Skype. The company says the budget phone will enable Microsoft to enter emerging markets it currently can't reach, but whether they still feel that way when Microsoft takes control in March remains to be seen. Samsung Galaxy S5 . Samsung launched a much more sensible, more cohesive smartphone than previous Galaxy S devices. There's a finger print scanner, a heart rate monitor, new camera tricks, and a clever way of making your downloads faster by combining Wi-Fi and signal coverage together. Samsung also announced a fitness band with a curved OLED screen as it continues its push into wearables. Expect to want the gold one come April. Sony Xperia Z2 . The Sony Xperia Z1 was very well received. However, the Z2 sports the latest Qualcomm processor, bringing with it a stack of improvements. That's the main takeaway here for Sony. Harder, better, faster, stronger, as Daft Punk would say. Early reports and a my own ""hands-on"" test suggest this is going to be one of the best Android phones released this year. Huawei MediaPad X1 . There are two ways to talk up your shiny new powerful tablet. The first is to let it quietly sell on the merits of what you include; the second is to do that and then make sure everyone that comes to your press conference knows how good it is by you trashing the nearest competition - in this case the Nexus 7 and the iPad mini. An amazingly crisp screen, slim form factor, 4G LTE capabilities and a price that is aggressive all help. A Bluetooth battery . Mobile World Congress is not all about state-of-the-art handsets. One gadget that caught my eye is the Tethercell. It appears to be an AA battery, but it's actually a case for a AAA battery. The case is also Bluetooth enabled, so after placing it in your child's noisy toy, you can shut it off with your phone when playtime gets too much to bear. Peace and quiet. How lovely.

Health officials are trying to contact hundreds of passengers who flew into Britain on the same plane as a man hospitalised with a deadly SARS-like virus. The man, who is thought to be a US doctor or nurse, fell ill after flying from Saudi Arabia to Chicago via Heathrow. He is believed to be the first American case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS. The unnamed man is recovering in a hospital in Indiana. Health officials are trying to contact hundreds of passengers who flew into Britain on the same British Airways plane as a man hospitalised with a deadly SARS-like virus. Two passengers have already been tracked down . Two British passengers have already been tracked down by health chiefs over fears they could have contracted the deadly virus. Public . Health England made the announcement after it emerged two passengers had . sat next to the American man, according to the Telegraph. MERS, . which is similar to SARS, has killed 107 people so far, with 345 confirmed cases . worldwide. About 140 of these have been reported since the beginning of . last month. Professor . Nick Phin, head of respiratory diseases for Public Health England, said . human-to-human transmission of the virus was ‘extremely rare’. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, also known as MERS, is a viral respiratory illness first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Little . is known about the condition but it has been found in bats and camels. Experts believe it is most likely humans were first infected by camels. Symptons include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is also spread among human who have close contact, experts say. So . far, all the cases have been linked to six countries in or near the . Arabian Peninsula, although it has spread to around 15 countries across . the world. Latest . figures from the World Health Organisation show there are at least 345 . reported cases. Of these, 107 have been killed by the condition. But . he told any passengers on British Airways flight 262, which left Riyadh . on April 23, to call 111 if they experienced respiratory problems or . felt unwell. After arriving at Heathrow, the unnamed man transferred to a flight for Chicago, America, where he was taken to hospital three days later. Mr Phin said the chances of passengers contracting the virus were very low, but that investigations - particularly into any passengers who continued on the second flight to America - were still continuing. Most cases of MERS cases have been found in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. But, with cases emerging in Britain, Greece, France, Italy and Malaysia, there are growing concerns about the potential global spread of the disease, mainly through airline passengers. The biggest reason for concern is that so little is known about the virus. It has been found in bats and camels and many experts say camels are the most likely way in which humans are infected. But the virus is also spread between humans who are in close contact with one another. According to the World Health Organisation, 107 people have been killed by MERS since 2012, while at least 345 have been infected. At least 140 of those cases have been reported since the . beginning of April. Mr Phin said: 'It's important to stress that the risk of the infection being passed to other passengers on Flight 262 is extremely low and there is no evidence from similar investigations of any evidence of person-person transmission. Egyptian Muslim pilgrims shown wearing masks as a precaution against MERS, which was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012. There are fears the virus will be spread further during pilgrimage season as millions of Muslims descend on the country to visit Mecca . Map of the world showing where MERS has been detected around the world, between April 2012 and April 2014 . 'PHE . staff have contacted - or have alerted the relevant public health . authorities in other countries - all but one of those passengers that . we know to have been sitting close to the case. 'We . are also in the process of informing other passengers on the plane, who . were not sitting in immediate proximity to the case, although all the . evidence shows that such individuals will have been at extremely low . risk. Particles of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome . 'None . of the passengers that have been contacted have reported any illness or . symptoms. We would only undertake laboratory tests if a passenger had . relevant symptoms. 'Our investigations into risks for any UK citizens on the flight from London to the US are continuing.' Dr . Anne . Schuchat, director of the Center for Disease Control's national center . for immunization and respiratory diseases, said the first American case . of . MERS was 'of great concern because of its virulence'. She . said the case represents 'a very low risk to the broader general . public', but MERS has been shown to spread to healthcare workers and . there are no known treatments for the virus. There is . now concern the disease could be spread further as millions from around . the world start to visit Mecca and other holy sites in Saudi Arabia for . the pilgramage season. The main Hajj season is in October this . year, but many Muslims also make Umrah, a less busy pilgrimage, throughout the year. The Saudi health minister Abdullah . al-Rabiah was sacked by the king last month after criticism the number . of MERS cases was rising. Mr al-Rabiah was criticised for not responding . effectively to the spread of the disease. Egypt, from where many of the pilgrims travel, has now issued a warning against travel to Saudi Arabia. The country's health ministry also said it was warning children under 15 and adults over 65, pregnant women and anyone suffering from chronic heart and chest diseases to postpone their pilgrimages. MERS causes a fever and a cough, but the effect can vary dramatically, with a high mortality rate in some people, but a majority testing positive with minor symptoms or none at all.","Health officials are trying to contact hundreds of passengers on flight .

41,359,"(CNN) -- Divers have found what they believe are human remains on the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship, the Italian Civil Protection agency announced Tuesday. The bodies of two people from the 2012 wreck have never been found: Russel Rebello of India and Maria Grazia Trecarichi of Sicily have been missing but presumed dead. Their bodies have long been believed to be either trapped beneath or inside the ship. Italian authorities also said two weeks ago that divers found what they thought were human remains on the ship's Deck 4. But they later determined that the remains were animal. The cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island in the Tyrrhenian Sea in January 2012, killing 32 of 4,200 people on board. The toll includes Rebello and Trecarichi. Rebello, 33, was a cruise waiter who was last seen helping passengers off the ship. Trecarichi was on the cruise to celebrate her 50th birthday with her 17-year-old daughter, who survived. The new discovery of remains comes about three weeks after engineers managed to rotate the ship back to vertical. Before that, the ship rested 20 months on its side, hindering a full examination. Costa Concordia righted . Authorities say the ship struck the rocks off Giglio Island after the captain, Francesco Schettino, ordered the liner to veer more than four miles off course to salute a former sea captain who had retired on Giglio. Schettino faces charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. His trial, which began with preliminary hearings in March, resumed last month. The trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses, including passengers, crew members and islanders, who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated. Schettino argues that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people, not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32. His defense is trying to prove, among other things, that the ship's watertight doors did not function properly, and that is the reason the ship sank, leading to all 32 deaths during evacuation. Schettino also has told the court that the ship would not have crashed had his helmsman turned it in the direction that Schettino told him to 13 seconds before impact. The helmsman, Jacob Rusli Bin, and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster. A Florence court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements. CNN's Hada Messia, Jason Hanna and Barbie Latza Nadeau contributed to this report.","Of 32 declared dead in the Costa Concordia accident, two bodies have yet to be recovered .

42,444,"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A far cry from the relative safety of a modern boxing ring, these stunning photos show the brutal West African sport of Dambe, and look like something out of Fight Club. The gloves are well and truly off here - instead, the contestants' stronger hands are wrapped in hard rope - which in the old days could even be dipped in resin and shards of broken glass. That practice is now illegal, but the sport is dangerous enough without it - the aim is to strike your opponent with kicks and punches, trying to make them fall to the floor. Scroll down for video . Brutal boxing: A fighter aims a high, right-footed kick at his opponent's head, who looks to duck away from the powerful attack . Eyes on the prize: One of the fighters pushes his opponent's lead arm away and goes to swing his rope-clad hand at his side . Clashing: Two older boys grapple, with one managing to land a painful uppercut to his opponent's exposed jaw . Hit where it hurts: A fighter clad in Chelsea FC shorts lands a left-handed punch to his unsuspecting opponent's forehead . Knocking someone down in Dambe is known as 'killing' -  the sport is traditionally practised as training for war, and shares much of the same terminology. Dambe belongs to the Hausa people. It is centuries old, but is still very popular in Nigeria, southern Niger and the south west of Chad. The tradition is entrenched among butcher caste groups and is very heavily focussed on communities.The sport started from clans of butchers travelling to different villages at harvest and fighting those from the area as part of the festival entertainment. Butchers come from a lower caste of Hausa society - they are the only ones who could ritually slaughter animals and handle meat. They would form teams from the village - known as armies - and challenge men from other butchers guilds, as well locals from the audience. Stand off: Two fighters scout each other out, looking for an opening to make the first move and try and achieve a 'killing' - the name for a take-down . Clubbed: Two younger fighters battle it out in the sandy arena, as one is caught on the back by a swinging arm, but avoids a killer shot . Watching on: Dambe is a very popular spectator sport, and those who come to watch bet on the outcome and chant support or taunts at the fighters . Chowing down: A fighter is caught in the mouth by a flailing arm but has his opponent on the ropes and falling to the ground with a strong head-shot . Nowadays, that sense of team is still very strong, and the sport is still dominated by the butchers caste, but competitors will often be very young - teenagers who train in gyms and yards - and will fight all year round. Fighters join a professional community which travel to fight, often now in temporary rings, rather than just inside a circle of spectators as in the past. They fight for prize money - just as they did traditionally - as harvest was a time of wealth. They wear shorts, rather than loincloths, and the pre-fight entertainment is more elaborate, and can even use sound systems. The fights in these pictures, taken in Nigeria, took place inside a sand-filled arena, which can be found in larger towns and are also used for wrestling championships. Team spirit: Dambe is traditionally a sport where fighters travel in teams, challenging people from other villages, and this is still the case today . Poised to strike: Two youngsters, one a left-hander, look to make the first move and get the upper hand in the bout . The gloves are off: The fighters do not wear gloves, but instead wrap their stronger hand with rope - which they once could dip in resin and shards of glass . Dambe used to include an element of wrestling, known as Kokawa, but is now essentially about punching and kicking. Fights last three rounds - though these rounds are not timed - their end is signified either when there is a lull in the action, one of the contestants or an official calls a stop to it, or when someone is knocked down. There are no official weight classes, though fighters are normally matched up with someone of a similar size. The strapped up strong arm is knows as the 'spear', while the front hand is called the 'shield' - and must be held with the palm open and facing the opponent. As well as for protection, the shield can also be used to grab hold of an opponent. Contestants can also kick with both legs - the lead leg can sometimes be wrapped with a chain and is also used for defence. Spectators are a key part of the whole event - they create the atmosphere by chanting to support or taunt the competitors, while betting is also prevalent. Other traditions include the use of amulets for supernatural protection, with some fighters wrapping them to their spear hand, while some of the fighting groups also ritually smoke marijuana before matches. Time to relax: A fighter spits water into the air and lets it fall back over his face to cool down after a brutal battle .","Dambe is a West African form of boxing which originates from the butcher caste of the Hausa people .

The Budweiser tycoon whose model girlfriend died at his mansion in 2010 from a drug overdose has settled a wrongful death suit with her family for $1.75million. Aspiring model Adrienne Martin, 27, was found dead just before Christmas in the bed of August Busch IV, the former chief of the Anheuser-Busch beer empire. Miss Martin, who had been dating 46-year-old Mr Busch for two years, died on December 19 after taking a lethal mixture of cocaine and the painkiller oxycodone. Today a judge approved the settlement before the parties - who have been locked in a longstanding legal wrangling - went to a contentious hearing next month. Unlawful death: An undated photograph of former Anheuser-Busch CEO August Busch IV, right, and his girlfriend Adrienne Martin who died of an overdose in his bed in December 2010 . According to STL Today, Martin's ex-husband Dr Kevin Martin sued Busch on behalf of their young son, Blake, in March of 2011.  Adrienne Martin's divorced parents, Larry Eby and Christine Trampler, then successfully appealed to join the lawsuit. Busch's attorney, St Louis lawyer Maurice Graham, released a statement this morning saying: 'Mr Busch cares deeply for Adrienne's son, Blake Martin, and is happy this long and at times bitter legal dispute is finally over. 'The only remaining issue was the division of the total settlement of $1.75 million. August's concern was that Blake receive as much of the total settlement as possible. Importantly, the dispute was resolved amicably today allowing everyone to avoid the contested hearing scheduled for November 14. August hopes to remain an important part of Blake's life.' According to the agreement, Blake Martin will be paid $1.35 million, Christine Trampler agreed to accept $200,000 and Larry Eby agreed to a $200,000 out-of-court settlement, which was put into an annuity for his grandson. Dreams: Miss Martin was an aspiring model . No charges were made in Miss Martin's death, despite the levels of cocaine and oxycodone being high enough to kill her, an autopsy found. A Medical Examiner concluded the former Hooters waitress had voluntarily taken the drugs so no one was held accountable. Last year, the beer tycoon offered the family $1.5million to settle the wrongful death claim. An attorney for Busch said at the time the offer had been made to provide for Blake's future and insisted the decision was not an admission of wrongdoing. Miss Martin, who suffered from an electrical heart condition known as Long QT syndrome, was due to start work at an energy firm before she died. Busch, 46, was the last member of his family to run Anheuser-Busch brewing, between 2006 to 2008, before it was sold to Belgian brewer InBev. The 2008 sale earned the heir about $100 million. He has since said he will step down from the company's board of directors, marking the end of the family's involvement in the brewery, the largest in the world. The tycoon has a troubled past. In 1983, Busch, then a 20-year-old University of Arizona student, left a bar with a 22-year-old woman. His black Corvette crashed and the woman, Michele Frederick, was killed. Busch was found hours later at his home. He suffered a fractured skull and claimed he had amnesia. After a seven-month investigation, authorities declined to press criminal charges, citing a lack of evidence. Two years later Mr Busch was acquitted of assault charges by a jury in St Louis after he was involved in a police chase. The great-great-grandson of Anheuser-Busch founder Adolphus Busch has spoken in the past of the deep devastation he felt following the sudden death of his girlfriend. 'I went to serve her breakfast in bed, and I couldn't wake her up,' he said after Miss Martin's death. ‘It's the saddest thing I've ever dealt with.'","Adrienne Martin, 27, died of a lethal mix of cocaine and oxycodone in 2010 .

Mr McKinnon, 46, has been fighting extradition for the past decade after hacking into Nasa and Pentagon databases while looking for evidence of ‘little green men’.

Mr Arquilla, a professor of defence analysis at the US Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, said Mr McKinnon’s extradition would not deter other hackers. He added: ‘Personally I think it’s ridiculous.

If you have a spare £1.8 million and you want to snap up the perfect home you have two options: a three-bedroom house in Britain's most expensive area or 25 of the same size in Scotland. A survey which compares house prices in 376 councils across the UK has ranked Kensington and Chelsea - where a three-bedroom home sells for £1.8 on average - as the most expensive place to live in the UK. Travel 400 miles north to East Ayrshire and you can buy a similar sized property for just £72,500. Mapped: The price of an average three-bedroom house across Britain and the combined salary a family would need to pay for the house in red . The average house price in the UK reached £250,000 last month - more than three times the cost of the average East Ayrshire home. The survey, reported in The Telegraph, was carried out by property analysts Hometrack. The company found that property prices in cities in the north such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham are at least five times cheaper than a house located on one of London's most expensive streets. Liverpool took the title of most affordable city in Britain to buy property. The average price of a three-bedroom house in the northern city is £82,000. After East Ayrshire, the second cheapest area was in Falkirk, Scotland, where a three-bedroom home costs £78,000. Third on the list was Blaenau Gwent, in Wales where the cost of the same house would come to £80,000. Pictured: Houses in Kensington and Chelsea, Britain's most expensive place to buy a three-bedroom home. The average price of a home in one of London's smartest boroughs is £1.8 million . East Ayrshire in Scotland is the cheapest place in the country to buy a three-bedroom home. At 72,500, you could buy 25 houses for the same price as one home in Kensington and Chelsea . Hometrack also compiled a top 20 list of the most expensive property areas. It found that 17 of the 20 areas with the highest price tags were within London. Two of the other hot spots were in Surrey. The areas were: Elmbridge, which includes the towns of Esher, Walton-on-Thames and Weybridge; and Mole . Valley, which covers Dorking and Leatherhead. The third was St Albans in . Hertfordshire. In the three hot spot areas outside of London, a three-bedroom house cost between . £403,750 and £450,000.

In London, boroughs such as Camden and . Hammersmith are prohibitive for middle class professionals because they . are priced out of the market by wealthier buyers and cash-rich . foreigners. Property giant Savills estimates that a third of property resale in prime locations involve foreign buyers. In Camden, a family would need to earn a combined sum of £225,329 to buy a mid-range £877,500 family home. In Hammersmith, family earnings needed to buy a £829,695 home would total £213,036. In addition to the property prices, experts also analysed the home owners' houses in the 376 councils. They found that, to pay off a mortgage on . a three-bedroom property in Kensington and Chelsea a family would need . to earn a pre-tax income of £462,214. In East Ayrshire, a household . salary would need to come to just £18,617. In a staggering 20 areas across the UK, to buy a three-bedroom property a family income would have to exceed £100,000.Places on the list include: St Alban's, Camden, and Westminster. St Albans is one of the most expensive places in the country to buy a property - outside of London. The average three-bedroom house costs £415,000 . You can buy a three-bedroom house in Oxford for £292,500. Pictured here is a row of colourfully-painted houses on an Oxford street .

And . although the national average income in the UK is £28,200, in 352 areas . a family's salary would have to exceed that sum if they wanted to . purchase a three-bedroom house. To calculate a family's salary, the analysts looked at the median price for a three-bedroom house in 376 council areas. They then worked out how much buyers would have to spend if they took out a 90 per cent repayment mortgage at four percent, over 25 years. The survey worked on the assumption that a family could afford to spend 30 per cent of their income on the mortgage. Richard Donnell from Hometrack told The Telegraph that the London market was 'driven by . cash purchases and interest-only mortgages, which aren’t available to . everyone'. He said that some couples buying prices down the property ladder might be put off by buying property because of the debt involved.","Average house in London's Kensington and Chelsea costs £1.8 million .

David Cameron went to ‘great lengths’ to woo Rupert Murdoch’s News International newspaper empire prior to the last general election, Lord Justice Leveson said today. The judge added the Prime Minister’s closeness to senior executives like Rebekah Brooks had created a problem of ‘public perception’, although he accepted there was no ‘deal’ of newspaper support for the expectation of policy favours. This prompted Mr Cameron to demand an apology from former Prime Minister Gordon Brown who said the Conservatives 'struck a deal' with Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers to gain positive coverage. Lord Leveson said the Prime Minister had been right to accept that politicians had ‘got too close to the media’ and that the relationship needed to be set on a ‘better footing’. 'Too close': Lord Leveson said that David Cameron's close relationship with Rebekah Brooks had caused problems with perception . Politicians will now have to record all contact they have with journalists and publish it. He said: ‘The problem is public perception. This section of the report has dealt with too many issues where the public, not knowing any more than it has (or, I might say, than what it reads in the newspapers), has been entitled to worry about the way things have been done and what has been going on. ‘A way of conducting relationships with the media which leads to a situation in which a public inquiry is needed to take an objective, not to say forensic, look at the matter in order to reassure the public cannot be considered as satisfactory or itself in the public interest. ‘Mr Cameron went to great lengths to secure meetings face-to-face with Mr Murdoch and other News International executives and editors. ‘The benefits of this may have played some part in the outcome but should not be overestimated. ‘The evidence does not, of course, establish anything resembling a ‘deal’ whereby News International’s support was traded for the expectation of policy favours.’ Failure: Jeremy Hunt (left) should have had more . control of his adviser Adam Smith (right) and his contact with News . Corporation lobbyist Fred Michel . Health minister Jeremy Hunt is the most senior politician to be directly criticised in the report. Mr Hunt was Culture Secretary in 2011 when he was handed responsibility for the News Corp bid to buy the whole of BSkyB. Spin: Lord Leveson also criticised New Labour's spin operation - led by Alastair Campbell . He is credited for putting in place ’wise and effective’ measures to prove he was handling the bid properly. But Mr Hunt is criticised for the way his special advisor Adam Smith had significant contact with News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel. ’Mr Smith already knew Mr Michel, and when faced with the intimacy, charm, volume and persistence of Mr Michel’s approaches, he was put in an extremely difficult position. Best practice... was not followed.’ Lord Leveson ’doubted the wisdom’ of giving Mr Smith the job. ’The consequential risks were then compounded by the cumulative effects of the lack of explicit clarity in Mr Smith’s  role, the lack of express instruction that it was clear that he fully understood, and a lack of supervision by Mr Hunt.’ It all gave a ’perception of bias’, he added. Concerns over how badly New Labour's spin operations, led for many years by Alastair Campbell, damaged public confidence in political communications were also raised by Lord Justice Leveson today. In a bid to end the 'wilderness years' of the 1980s and 1990s Labour strayed into territory that some believed marked a breakdown of 'public trust engineered by political self-interest', the report said. It added: 'If New Labour did not invent 'spin', it nevertheless found itself in an unprecedented place in relation to news management as an agenda item in its own right. 'On the one hand, its election-winning strategy in 1997 explicitly had in mind the lessons to be learned from the recent past. 'On the other, there is an obvious question about the extent to which a media strategy of 'neutralising' those sections of the press which had been hostile to the party in the 1980s and in the run-up to the 1992 general election became a victim of its own success, and resulted in diminishing public confidence in political communications.'","Lord Leveson says PM's relationship with Rebekah Brooks was bad for 'public perception'

Six players, including Nick Cullen, who beat Scott by a shot to win last month's Australian Masters, ended the day at five-under while a total of 44 players were under par. Conditions on day two were perfect at the Royal Pines Resort Queensland, near where Scott was raised, and the defending champion made four birdies but gave back a shot with a bogey at the par-four 13th hole. 'I really want to finish this off with a win and hang on to trophy this year and go into next year feeling a little bit chuffed with myself,' Scott told reporters.

Payment was required before the room could be allocated. ‘‘The receptionist then heard Nicholas refer to another member of staff as a “f***ing idiot”. The defendant was using his mobile phone at the time and swearing to who he was talking to. Punishment: The couple, of Salford, are due to be sentenced on December 9 and were bailed on condition they do not contact witnesses or go near the hotel . ‘Kirsty was heard saying “f***ing monkeys” then “f***ing P***s”. He took this remark as a reference to the ethnicity of himself and colleagues and the couple were not allowed to remain in the hotel due to their behaviour.’ She added: ‘Kirsty ran at the staff swearing and spitting at them. Nicholas then made comments that he would assault them if they touched his wife. He was pinned down and stopped from hitting anyone. Kirsty ran towards the staff. They stopped her and she said “get off me your P*** b******”. She attempted to punch him and spat on his shirt and jacket. ‘The defendant clearly most responsible here is Kirsty Bigland.’ The couple, of Salford, are due to be sentenced on December 9 and were bailed on condition they do not contact witnesses or go near the hotel.","Nick and Kirsty Bigland rowed with Hilton Hotel staff on wedding night .
